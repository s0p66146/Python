oh i hadnt heard
Well you know now :)
I feel like protest isn't going to cut it if they blatantly looked over our opposition.
I'd say its time for a revolution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Title: No violence tomorrow pleaseAgreed no violence none
Seconded.
Everyone needs to keep in mind there are housewives and elderly people who have no damn clue what Net Neutrality even is. The whole point of these protests is to make noise and bring awareness to the cause, but we need to make sure the FCC are the ones that look like the assholes to the uninformed here. So DON'T go fucking up Verizon stores tomorrow. If that kind of shit makes the news WE will look like the assholes and the whole endeavor will have done more harm than good.
The protests are probably the ONLY way to MAYBE save net neutrality excluding any court rulings post December 14th. Think about it, the opposition has been almost entirely virtual up until this point. Now image this; 600 DIFFERENT protests at 600 DIFFERENT locations across the entire United States in all 50 states. Now image thousands of people at EACH of these 600 protests. The FCC may not care but a movement this big that can be visually seen outside the realm of the internet I can’t imagine any possible way Congressman WOULDNT think that their careers were on the line
The store employees also have zero control over company policy.  They just work there.
Wrong.

Freedom cannot be won by standing idle and demanding change. When you go protest tomorrow, think of what you can do to make an internet that they have no control over
Please be more specific, I am going, would like to know what I should actually do then. 
If we burn down every Verizon store then we can save net neutrality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Title: Received a response from my state representative! He's in!This is amazing! This is good news, sort of.

What a shame though I have contacted my reps and waiting for a reply. One Democrat showed his support but since TN is backward ass republican state, others are siding with FCC, AGAINST our CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT for freedom of speech. I'm so sick of Republicans destroying everything and messing with our constitution then dare call themselves "patriots" UGHHHH
i rather the republicans fight amongst themsleve than actually be politicians, because they arnt good at that. they are better at fighting amongst each other.
Good work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 Title: What do we do if Net Neutrality gets repealed?Dude, I love you, and all of you
[:{](http://edkandcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/twitter-introduces-likes-social-media-marketing.jpg)
boycott the services, i know people say they cant live without INTERNET AT home, i know people who dont even subscribe to any ISPs, and they only use thier school's wifi, public wifi, libraries. Netflix, and facebook is not a excuse to not boycott.
another alternative is protesting, i find this inefficient as this makes them just ignore you more.

I uh, I mean like after it happens but good bot non the less

Fuck it communicate with radio assassinate all and every government official we make our own communist government.
lmfao
I actually did some research and there is stuff we can do if it does get repealed...

        With Net Neutrality being lost as an Article 2 Utility and moving back down to an Article 1 on December 14th,
We have to shift our Focus to the Federal Trade Comittee who will indoubitly be in charge of regulating the ISP's next. If the ISP's begin to promote unfair Practices affecting Commerce, we can alert the FTC under the rule set of...

                15 usc Section 45(a)(1)  

        This would allow them to be regulated under Net neutrality rules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 Title: It's not about the money, it's not about the speed, it's about giving the ability of censorship to the top .01%...No, it's the money. Axing net neutrality will earn ISPs billions without them having to lift a finger
And the money they'll get from people and government officials for censoring things.  
i prrsonally think its all about putting trump at the mercy of msm
Trump is supporting it, he is the one that put Ajit Pai in his position.

Attack on Paitan.
A true masterpiece friend
That was beautiful
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8 Title: Received a response from my congressman! But I'm not sure how to read it!Nah, he's Team Pai.
Read it with your middle finger 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 Title: Spineless InvertebratePlease do not glorify Wikipedia vandalism.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 Title: And it begins.That doesn’t seem like NN though.  More like YouTube doesn’t want to keep supporting the app that allows that device to view YouTube.  What device is it anyway?
Yeah, Google recently announced that they're pulling YouTube from Amazon devices.
Looks like a Smart TV. Apps come and go on them fairly often
This is so illustrative though. Everyone is worried about ISPs blocking content, and here comes Google ACTUALLY blocks content. OP, while somewhat confused about the current bounds of this debate, is absolutely right to be pissed off.
I don't think this is a NN issue, more like crossfire from a legal battle.
This isn't Net Neutrality it's 2 giant companies that don't want to play nice. Amazon refuses to sell Chromecasts on their site so Google is pulling YouTube from all Amazon devices. It's certainly bullshit, but it's not an ISP thing.
So if net neutrality is gutted, let’s start boycotting the internet, use mail, and organize to get everyone who supported its gutting fired from office, as well as voted out
Sorry, i need internet to do my job like many others.
On shrooms right now. 

This can work...

I really hate the human race. ( **This was the greatest Invention ever that the human race could have ever possibly imagined and yet like everything else they're going to destroy it.**)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 Title: What will be the immediate effects if net neutrality is destroyed?Anti-NN companies like Comcast will almost immediately introduce paid fast lanes to "help" their customers. Then they will slowly put out more "amazing" plans that will just be the service they're already giving right now and cost way more, while simultaneously throttling and adding data caps to the normal plans. It will only go downhill from there until internet will look like cable TV 
If you have Comcast you probably won’t see anything until at least September 2018. This is because of a requirement that Comcast had to accept when they acquired Universal. Even if you don’t have Comcast I would say that nothing will happen for anybody until the garunteed legal challenges are resolved. That is because it would be a idiotic move for the ISPs to instantly roll out changes as that would likely not be in their favor in the midst of legal challenges. So even if the courts don’t rule in our favor the changes probably won’t happen for a while. That being said there seems to be a slowly increasing legal opinion that at least some parts of Pais repeal likely won’t fly in court. To be honest I feel the chances of a COMPLETE repeal of net neutrality that will be upheld in the courts are pretty slim. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 Title: A guy at work may be against Net Neutrality2005 - Madison River Communications blocked VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to that.

2005 - Comcast denied access to p2p services without notifying customers.

2007 - AT&T blocked Skype and other VOIPs because they didn't like the competition for their cellphone services.

2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except YouTube. They actually sued the FCC over this.

2011 - AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to tethering apps on the Android marketplace, with Google's help
.
2011 - AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet because it competed with their own payment apps.

2012 - Verizon demanded Google to block tethering apps on Android because it let owners avoid the $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do it as part of a winning bid on a airwaves auction. They were fined 1.25 million over this.

2012 - AT&T tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

2013 - Verizon stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the Net Neutrality rules in place.

2016 - Comcast instituted a mandatory data cap on all services with a $50 fee to get unlimited data. This allowed them to slow the bleeding of cord cutters, trapping them with fees from trying services like Sling or DirecTV Now.

2017 - Time Warner Cable refused to upgrade their lines in order to get more money out of Riot Games (creators of League of Legends) and Netflix.

There's also this tweet that links to several articles, court cases, etc that give a bit of a history of what actually happened before Title II.

He's not lying about being transparent; everyone knows he's killing net neutrality.

19 Title: Would the Supreme Court even vote for net neutrality to be upheld (if it gets that far)?Supreme court is basically a rubber stamp for the republicans. They dint do anything to the TAX CUTS that is happening right now.
Probably not. Not because they don’t want to uphold net neutrality but more likely because it probably won’t get to the surpreme court

I'm against repealing the net neutrality laws because in my opinion there has never been a single time in human history in which people have been this untied as a species, the internet helps to connects us to so many people we may lose contact with other the years like our family and friends, it also helps to open us up to so many different cultures and different years of living, also like a library the internet is a place of unlimited information which allows us educate ourselves so much better and alloy us to grow much more as a society and a democracy so this is why I am asking you to vote against this, have a good day



Good luck Dude.

I'll have no choice.
Yeah I feel like more people should realize if this does happen they have the choice to unplug and not use the Internet. We actually do have some power stop giving ISPs our money.

Good bot
It depends on their strategy. In the end, I think they’re going to roll out something similar to apples App Store, where you can pay a fee to download an app and use it from its developers. Perhaps they’ll bundle like you’ve seen in cable for desktop. Its disgraceful
I only want Reddit and Steam, can't we make our bundle?

If you haven't already sent a message to your representative, this is why it is important.What he doesnt mentioned, is that the onlY ISP to lose out are COMCAST, at&t verizon, and twc,,,,etc. HES ACTUALLY stating the exact opposite of whats happening with NN in place.

Disney is taking away content, making the service less valuable. Repealing net neutrality will drive up the price. Between the two, Netflix is a sinking ship.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46 Title: Does anyone else see the irony here, or just me?IT PRETTY much sums it up about these companies that were here in 2014, but are mysteriously absent in this fight. They will benefit from NN getting repealed.

53 Title: Does peering come under Net Neutrality?Thanks for asking a smart question. Peering is obviously related to net neutrality, but not covered by the no blocking/no throttling/no paid prioritization rules. The current Open Internet regulations do give the FCC authority to oversee some peering agreements, but does not impose strict rules. For example, the Verizon/Comcast-Netflix peering agreements in which the Netflix pays the ISP for better interconnection is not prohibited (or even really looked down upon) by the FCC currently.

55 Title: Desperate college student that needs help!!!Can I give you a friendly suggestion?
Net neutrality topic is complicated and there are too many contrasting news and also some fake news like the Portugal one.  
People say that ISPs could block and trotthle but watching it in a economic and commercial way after all are companies and they don't want to lose users.  Yes, some zones have only one ISP, but zones like big cities have more choice and they would lose an uncountable quantity of users.  
Net neutrality is too controversial topic, could also be that people give you wrong or incorrect informations.

I appreciate your suggestion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
56 Title: Those in power don't like copy and paste messages, but they can respond to us that way?Cuz they're the ones in power, not us.
That's my point.  They want us to jump over hoops of decorum and say we're disingenuous if we don't voice our arguments in a specific way, but they feel they can treat us the way they don't want to be treated and everything's okay because they're in charge.

63 Title: My congressman wants to protect surfing the waves but not surfing the net. He replied to my email stating his opposition to Net Neutrality.Dear [petemcfraser]
 
Thank you for contacting me with your views regarding 
Federal policy relating to internet access and “net neutrality”.  I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concerns.
 
As you may know, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a set of regulations known as the Open Internet Order.  Among other things, these rules reclassified broadband internet access service (BIAS) from an information service to a telecommunications service under the Communications Act of 1934.  Because telecommunications services may be regulated much more stringently than information services, the FCC was then able to implement restrictions on internet service providers (ISP) to impose what is now commonly known as net neutrality.  Those regulations included, among other things: (1) a requirement that ISPs disclose information regarding the management of their networks, (2) a prohibition on mobile and broadband ISPs from blocking lawful websites, content, apps, and other web-based products, and (3) a prohibition on unreasonable discrimination in the transmission of lawful network traffic.  On May 18, 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would reexamine the 2015 Open Internet Order.  The proposed rule would, among other things, reverse the Title II utility designation and seek public comment on the merits of other existing regulations.
 
I believe internet’s success, to a large degree, is attributable to the “hands off” approach employed by the federal government prior to the 2015 Open Internet Order.  Federal regulation rarely if ever encourages innovation and growth in any given industry.  **Thus, I support the FCC’s reversal of its 2015 decision.**  Should Congress consider legislation regarding net neutrality, it would be under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  While I do not serve on this committee, I will keep your views in mind should any piece of legislation on this subject receive a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
 
Again, thank you for giving me the benefit of your views.  Please continue to keep me informed on any federal issue of importance to you. 

Sincerely, 
 
Dana Rohrabacher
Member of Congress


I love how his support is based on the mis-informed belief in the logical fallacy that the internet flourished BECAUSE the government didn't regulate it through the 90s. The FACT is that the internet was OPEN and UNRESTRICTED in the 90s; we didn't have broadband, and ISPs didn't have the technology available to filter traffic the way the can today.  This is a perfect example of when correlation is NOT causation!
Email him back asking him why he selling out the nation. He asked for any issues that are important to you...
He’ll have a stroke before Dec. 14.

It will only benefit large ISP companies. Large non-ISP companies are also getting the raw deal because ISPs will be able to charge them to reach customers, simultaneously to charging customers to reach them.

I'd join, but I'm paranoid. I'm Canadian, so I'm not sure if it would go or not.
Until this can get clarified, all I can do is just say "Curse you, A-shit Pie."
Just. Do. It. ;)
I don’t think they care where you are from, but at least ur on the NA continent. Also, it’s basically to get them to realize a SHIT TON OF PPL WANT NET NEUTRALITY.
Without Net Neutrality more people would have a life, I think we should discontinue Net Neutrality because of this. Although i would miss the internet rip. Also NN was only announced in 2015, what could change?
Please leave the internet. Your kind is not welcomed here.

68 Title: Voting with my wallet."Thank Ajit Pai for my cancellation"
Good one. Ok, that'll be on the termination note.
Got news for you, they can not be on Comcast lines all they want, they still don't own the lines and will most likely go out of business when Net Neutrality is slashed
The internet company anyways. Not sure about the cell company

74 Title: Let the FCC know what you think!They literally just said that they don't care what people think.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75 Title: SC senators Net Neutrality email response.Another Republican Senate supports Net Neutrality? Things are looking up!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76 Title: If the FCC doesn't care about the public's opinions, then what do we do?There is something that people need to be doing that I don’t think enough people are. You need to THREATEN the careers of the sellout congressmen. That would have a greater chance of working as it appeals to their selfish desires
Yes but the only people that will win in this country are democrats and republicans.  So you basically pick one of two evils.
I said yesterday that a dozen senators sent a letter asking Pai to delay the vote. Pai refused because he writes the rules and, as a bully, will see it through. 

But 12 Senators acting to send a letter is a start. We must keep the pressure up. 

Pai will make the repeal happen on 12/14. Our best hope is that Pai continues to act like he has so far. It will burn bridges. Pai may get his repeal, but little else will get done. 

* Pai's declarations that Pro NN folks are desperate and other words may haunt him. Pai cannot set the narrative. Politicians HATE that!
I personally think we need to take advantage of this... if NN is revoked sue the crap out of any ISP that has a regional monopoly.  I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/7hi14y/it_is_our_patriotic_duty_to_sue_our_isp_if_net/) about this... hopefully it will get some more visibility.

Here's the plain text version:

Johnny Isakson,

The free market doesn’t work when our internet providers are monopolies in many parts of the country. I agree that unnecessary regulations are harmful to consumers, but this is NECCESSARY regulation which ENCOURAGES innovation. The internet has always been a level playing field where new ideas and businesses can flourish. By deregulating the ISPs, you give them the power to crush innovation. For example, a new video streaming service wouldn’t be able to pay Comcast $50 million/year for premium speeds the way someone like YouTube might. A new service or product will have a harder time succeeding in this environment.

Nobody should control the internet. I’m not asking the government to control it. I’m asking them to make sure NOBODY controls it. I’m not asking the government to regulate the internet. I’m asking them to regulate the behavior of ISPs.

Also, just because Obama did something doesn’t inherently make it bad. Don’t undo Net Neutrality just because he helped establish it.

Thanks.


On Dec 5, 2017, at 10:36 AM, Senator Johnny Isakson <senator@isakson.senate.gov> wrote:



Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality. I appreciate your thoughts on this subject and I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to you.

I have consistently been opposed to attempts by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the Internet, because I believe that the competition created by the free market will better ensure that the Internet remains open and free. I also believe that unnecessary regulations have the potential to stifle innovation and be harmful to consumers. 

On February 26, 2015, former Chairman Tom Wheeler and the FCC released new net neutrality regulations to the public. The new regulations, adopted by a vote of 3-2, reclassify broadband Internet services as telecommunications services subject to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This classification gives the FCC regulatory authority over the Internet and access to its content. While I believe we must remain vigilant against any anti-competitive actions by service or content providers, I do not support this reclassification of the Internet or the expansion of the federal government’s control over the Internet. 

On May 18, 2017, the FCC issued a new notice of proposed rulemaking to reconsider the net neutrality rules put in place during the Obama administration. I support the FCC’s decision to revisit this rule, and I will keep a close eye on these issues moving forward. I will also keep your thoughts and concerns in mind should any related legislation come before the Senate for consideration.

Thank you again for contacting me. Please visit my webpage at www.isakson.senate.gov for more information on the issues important to you and to sign up for my newsletter.


Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson
United States Senator

You have no money and so you have no voice.  This is what I have been trying to explain here https://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/7hs699/no_you_cannot_keep_net_neutrality_you_have_no/

All the best you could hope for is if your senator happens to open up his spam box.
You're a fucking croney.  That isn't "how the world works".  It's how people have led the america work BY not caring, exactly what you are trying to tell people to do.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79 Title: The official response by the FCC regarding Reddit’s submissions (source) ‪http://go.usa.gov/xn8T9‬It shouldn’t take a data scientist too long to remove the duplicates.
The government is shitty at any task, but when it comes to corruption. They somehow know what they are doing, amazes me.
They really suck and fact to myth. Terribly so. 

The majority of online campaigns use these tactics. Simple comparison would break apart this argument. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80 Title: Isnt the repeal highly likely to be shot down in court?I’d say it’s highly likely certain parts of the repeal will be, particularly the pre 2015 parts he’s trying to repeal 
Hopefully the entire repeal will be unjustified in the courts eyes. Just think: obviously the decision to put net neutrality into place was justified, so maybe repealing it wont seem so.... appealing
I recall them re-affirming the 2015 rulings at least twice, so there is a chance that they will deny the repeal, especially with the sheer lack of evidence Ajit Pai actually has.
I would love nothing more than for the repeal to get denied but Ajit strikes me as the kind of guy that’s not above bribing a judge. Gotta spend money to make money.
parts at least. Also the whole 'put isps over the fucking states' parts.

Hopefulyl they will just straight up rule hte proposal as meaningless. Courts can be bout but public opinion can impact them...... Just not the house or congress >_<
Fortunately it looks like the Court of Appeals are stacked with more Liberal leaning judges.

All the Circuit Courts except for 5 through 8 have a higher proportion of judges appointed by democratic presidents.

That means 9 out of the 13 circuit courts are liberal leaning. We just have to avoid those conservative courts.

Also, I've read that it's much harder to confirm a ruling then to overturn one. Appeals are typically made when one party thinks there is a very good chance for the decision to be ruled their way. That's why overturn rates are very high.

Not to mention, this seems like it would be a very easy case to win for Team Net Neutrality. Even with conservative judges, I see this being overturned by the circuit courts.

As for the Supreme Court, it would almost surely not be heard by them. The US Supreme Court receives around 7000 petitions per year, but usually only hears about 100 of them.
I reaaally hope youre right

81 Title: FCC comment on Reddits fight for net neutrality! (Source) ‪ http://go.usa.gov/xn8T9‬--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
82 Title: #SaveTheInternet Net Neutrality Livestream all day today!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
83 Title: To anyone having to deal with people who support the removal. It is indirect government censorship.Also one of the reasons we can bear arms is to defend against false arrest or goverment people killing to control opinion and viewpoints
Since Internet is born to 2015 this didn't happen.

>And people may say I'm sick

Not sick but you watch too much movies. 

I support net neutrality but make this sci-fictional mental movie, give fake news and make fake emails go against the cause. Don't help at all. 
I actually don't watch many movies, and I did state that it was my opinion, I don't know how that is fake news.  Maybe someone else takes it and makes a connection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84 Title: We didn't have net neutrality before 2015. So what if it's revoked?2005 - Madison River Communications blocked VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to that.

2005 - Comcast denied access to p2p services without notifying customers.

2007 - AT&T blocked Skype and other VOIPs because they didn't like the competition for their cellphone services.

2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except YouTube. They actually sued the FCC over this.

2011 - AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to tethering apps on the Android marketplace, with Google's help.

2011 - AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to Google Wallet because it competed with their own payment apps.

2012 - Verizon demanded Google to block tethering apps on Android because it let owners avoid the $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do it as part of a winning bid on a airwaves auction. They were fined 1.25 million over this.

2012 - AT&T tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

2013 - Verizon stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the Net Neutrality rules in place.

2016 - Comcast instituted a mandatory data cap on all services with a $50 fee to get unlimited data. This allowed them to slow the bleeding of cord cutters, trapping them with fees from trying services like Sling or DirecTV Now. 

2017 - Time Warner Cable refused to upgrade their lines in order to get more money out of Riot Games (creators of League of Legends) and Netflix.

ISP's already have proven that without rules in place, they will behave in a way that can dictate how you use your internet connection.
I hope there are articles of this, or at some sort of documents that proves these. Be great to forward and use against the repeal before the deadline.
Great examples. Thank you!
As you can see the block or throttle has been rare.  
People are making a big deal about it, and they distract from what we must really fight for.  
Will change almost nothing, but keep net neutrality is quite better.

89 Title: Would Gov Shutdown delay FCC Vote?I hope 
I hope also.
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/18/government-shutdown-heres-who-keeps-working-and-who-doesnt.html

I am a DC area native and resident so your national news about DC is local news for me. 

The FCC Commissioners would be so high up the ranks that they would be important enough to be exempt is my guess. 

That means The FCC Vote would go on as scheduled is my bet. 

But with Trump loud mouthing and demanding, a government shutdown is almost certain. 

Nope.

Not if they vote for a [2-week extension,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/government-shutdown-republicans-congress-spending.html) which would put off a shutdown until after the 14th.

&nbsp;

[Possibility of a Government Shutdown Again Looms](https://www.fedsmith.com/2017/12/04/possibility-government-shutdown-looms/)

> Lawmakers hope to pass a two week extension that was put forth in the House over the weekend to buy more time to work out an agreement. Such a measure would extend government funding through December 22.

&nbsp;

It would also depend on if FCC employees are "excepted".

>**Exempt Employees**

> Some federal employees are considered “excepted” (a.k.a. exempt) from a shutdown and therefore will still work and get paid, although the pay will likely come after the shutdown is resolved. OPM describes it this way:

>   The term “excepted” is used to refer to employees who are funded through annual appropriations who are nonetheless excepted from the furlough because they are performing work that, by law, may continue to be performed during a lapse in appropriations. Excepted employees include employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property or performing certain other types of excepted work.

Ajit Pai and the Republicans may be calculating on the budget furor to act as a smokescreen to their vote (like they do with holidays) and to help tamp down on the anticipated backlash.

91 Title: We've caught him red handed.If rob banks would be legal, you would rob it?  No, because you have moral.  
They will lose tons of users and piss off big companies if they will do it, they could but is not sure that they will. 
They are in control of the entire internet. These rules apply to the entire internet. The only way to lose users is for them to stop using the internet entirely, which is unlikely. Piss off big companies? Sure. 

Also, I might have morals, but this greedy dirt bag doesn't. He is robbing those banks because no one can stop him and it will get him more money. 
Honestly we sorta knew about this aspect already. He stated he wanted to remove much of the regulatory authority over them. And removing sectoin 8 stuff would do just that. 

Albeit it might be doing too much though. REpublicans won't repeal this shit, but FCC changes go to court to be determined if justified. The original changes, title 2, had been listed as justified already. Thus these new changes will have to go through......
And the whole 'remove an entire fucking section' thing, if this is valid and not changed in order to make it more court palatable, would not fly well. 
But this is proof. There is no legal reason to remove "No Throttling", and therefore, it can be proved to someone who is horribly misguided and believes in the repeal, that Ajit Pai is in fact trying to take away the free and open internet, not just "allowing for innovation" and all that FCC Propaganda.

I know that we already knew he was bad. But now we can prove that he is.
This nut ball is not a Republican.... there are people in the Senate that are hired to claim there republicans  when there actually not. Obama put that pie guy in the fcc, now why would Obama put a Republican in the fcc?? No he wouldn't, You all have to understand things are so neatly put in place and so snakish that things go under the radar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
92 Title: .@AjitPaiFCC Fuck you. You’re the biggest lying piece of shit in government and fucked over all of America just for a few telecommunications executives and your old friends at Verizon. You failed at your job by representing the 1% with money and not America as a whole.Hah, that's funny. As if 1% of people will benefit from this. I doubt it. There are probably 5000 people max who benefit here. Not even close to 1%
Yeah true I was just going with the saying it would be less than .1% I think actually
“i like net neutrality”

*tries to revoke it*
I'd say Trump is still the biggest lying piece of shit in government fucking over all of America, followed by the GOP, then maybe Pai.
*Trump appointed Ajit Pai*, so there's that going for the both of them.
i have mixed opinions on this topic but Ajit Pai has some sense in what he is saying as if the large internet suppliers make the public pay for the services they (the public) will possibly move towards local providers that will provide services for a cost but won't make you pay as the big monopolies/ providers want you to pay (certain types of apps in bundles).  For the smaller providers, they will give you free access to individual websites and apps, but will make you pay for their services as the bigger companies do now.  I live in a England and we have no net neutrality (i think, please correct me if im wrong) and we used to get our internet from BT (big company) but we realised that they were bad, so we switched to a local company and they have been so much better off, the prices are cheaper, and they upgrade your Wi-Fi, and if so you usually have to pay less for your monthly payments with better Wi-Fi, the only downside I can see is that the Wi-Fi may not be as good, but it works fine and is certainly cheaper.  Also with BT we got rid of then a few years ago but we are still getting bills from them.
We domt have “local companies”

For us, its the big guys or not internet for you
Yeah in most parts of the country you only have one or two options. For example in my area it’s either Comcast who has good speeds or a little company who is way slower and that’s it there’s no other options. 
There are extremely few local companies in the US. 87% of Americans have 2 or fewer choices for a broadband ISP, over 50% have only 1 choice. His entire argument hinges upon the existence of a free market that doesn't exist.
We do not have 'local providers' outside of the large ISPs. Those do not really exist, and if they did, they would still be paying the big ISP's as they have to get their connection from somewhere.... England would have net neutrality as a law, but Brexit happened first is my understanding, as the EU has a regulation for Open Internet Access.
Is this what you want? https://mobile.twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/923701871092441088/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iflscience.com%2Ftechnology%2Fcountry-net-neutrality%2F
Also i have another point getting rid of net neutrality will mean that websites with higher traffic will be sped up, but simultaneously sacrificing speed from a website that has no traffic, giving a better experience for users using more popular websites.  I'll use an example/ simple analogy.

Lets say I want to mail a simple letter, and someone else wants to mail a big heavy weight, with net neutrality, we both have to pay the same price for mailing it, but without net neutrality, I will have to pay less for mailing a small light letter than the person who wants to mail a dumbbell.
 
Yes maybe but that’s not the point of the internet the point is to connect people and foster innovation and that won’t happen if no one can use a smaller website that not as many people are using. For example a small local business would be completely screwed over in this system and we all know politicians love to say how small business is the backbone of our economy but this is going to majorly hurt small businesses.
Yes but it also gives them the ability to censor whoever and whatever they want.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
93 Title: Why do we need net neutrality?NN is what keeps us safe from the dirty tricks of large ISP's. Without it, they have absolute freedom to throttle (slow up or slow down) what websites you visit, completely block some parts of the internet off, and control what you see and do online. Basically, extreme internet authoritarianism. 
Many people see the examples of ISPs purposefully limiting band width to content (like verizon did to Netfix) as a sign of things to come.  Personally this isn't that much of an issue to me.  My concern is that people who feel threatened by the opinions on the internet and only want their small echo chamber will now be able to do that by purchasing their "optimal" package.  It's like if someone gave Trump a personalized TV package.  He would only see fox news, and all opposing views would be muted.  This divide is already way too often and the removal of NN will (in my view) only make it worse.

94 Title: STOP AJIT!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
95 Title: Idear/cutthecord is planning something like this if the repeal goes through
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
96 Title: What happens to music services such as Spotify, Apple Music etc if this NN is passed?You will listen to music anyway. The fake news that you should pay more came from the misleaded "Portugal example" and old screenshots that are maybe from the beginning of '00 (because in 2014 this didn't happen).  
If they would block or throttle would be unfair competition and companies will not accept this. 
You'll be able to listen to them... if you pay extra money to have them stream in higher quality on top of whatever subscription fee you're already paying

Also it is entirely possible that Google could lock Apple apps from their devices and vice versa
Then how would I use google drive?

101 Title: Charter admitted last year that Title II never really hurt its businessIs this good or bad?
Good is means net neutrality had no effect on the business of the company's. But the FCC's whole argument is basically the opposite of what the 2nd leading internet provider said a year ago.

105 Title: I’m here thinking that the world is moving even further into the future where it connects everything and everyone together to an incomprehensible level. But with the FCC trying to take down net neutrality it genuinely feels like we’re going back in time. #NetNeutrailityHumanity is approaching type 1 status, and the internet is an accessible global communications system, such as the internet, is one of the defining characteristics of a type 1 civilization. So you are correct.
The world is moving forward, it’s just the USA that’s not.
Coverage of Net Neutrality on the front page of the news:

CNN - One article near the bottom of the page. (CNN.com) 

Fox - Nothing. I didn’t see a single article. Not even under the tech category. (Foxnews.com)

MSNBC - No article, as far as I could tell. (MSNBC.com)

ABC - Nothing. (http://abcnews.go.com)

NBC - Nada. (Nbcnews.com) 

CBS - Nope. (Cbsnews.com) 
Could be true that we go back, but also not.
Then why they are saying that 5g will come?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
106 Title: FCC ignoring 50,000 complaints to save Net Neutrality. We're fucked. It's over“The people have the power” man fuck this country
it is the truth. without us the government, fuck even corporations, have no power. its the actual fact of the matter. we validate their political positions, we validate the american dollar. we build the infrastructure, fight the wars, and police crime. the problem is no one is willing to put aside pride and opinion and look at the facts of the matter. 
Fact remains government and corporate is being excessively exploitative. The long and short of it. But without the 300 million people, they mean nothing. 

The problem is people get far too stuck in their ways and opinion is valued over truth and information. How that issue can be solved is a a philosophical but frustrating one. 

The power government has over us is as thin as a thread. But we handle it as if it is stronger than steel and thicker than a redwood.

He looks like a real good boy.
I like him, he seems nice.
That looks like Barry Benson if he were human
keep going.
i don't see the problem with net neutrality being repealed, ajit pai has a plan!
Edit: wow thank you so much /u/zories3 for the reddit gold!, didn't think this comment would have so much positivity in this community.
This is my Redditor. He sold me, my fellow Redditors, and this website to the telecom lobbies for the price of one month of Reddit Gold.

I genuinely think he is more likely to get assassinated than Trump, at this point. Not advocating, just wondering how he's ever going to feel safe.
If anything, his entire family is threatened too. People already know where he lives, even if he is now feeling protected by police, it isn't going to stop potential riots and protests.

119 Title: Crowder clip on net neutrality, worth watching...I had to click off the video after he said he wished broadband was as good as mobile carrier plans...

Oh, and apparently Google wouldn't be affected by the outcome of net neutrality... ok?
you misunderstood the point... Mobile plans ARE better than Broadband plans.  He wasn't comparing speed.  He was comparing growth, improvement, price and competition.  Look at where broadband internet was 10 years ago vs where mobile was 10 years ago.  The prices have plummeted and the bandwidth has skyrocketed.  Broadband internet however has changed very little in much of the country.  Only in places with lots of big broadband providers has broadband improved much at all.

He said Google wouldn't be effected AS MUCH, which they wouldn't, because they don't use an ISP.  They are their own ISP.  They are even running their own fiber lines to become another big player.

125 Title: It's starting... Is this legal?Verizon can't even wait for the legislation to pass, holy shit.
Yeah, Comcast is already throttling our internet too.
This would be the beginning of Overreaction.

Its the first of four steps to fully embrace life after Net Neutrality.

In this ad they're just promoting a basic plan and listing it's features. Once they have their teeth into the non-neutral net the web will be cut up into parcels that you'll buy based (fundamentally) on bandwidth.

There will be Comcast's "Gamer's Package",  the "Movie Package", etc. And no, you won't be allowed to use left over Movie bandwidth to play a game or two, you'll have to pay for both.

Edit: "HD Quality" and "DVD Quality" are the same. Somebody in Marketing thought they would add "extra value" by changing the semantics. Its all that company does anymore.
>"HD Quality" and "DVD Quality" are the same. Somebody in Marketing thought they would add "extra value" by changing the semantics. 

That's not true, DVDs are 480p while HD is at least 720p. A quick Google search says the difference between streaming the two is 2.5Mbps for DVD quality and 5Mbps HD. 

This shit needs to be on blast
I saw that on my subscription too, fucking capitalism...
This seems to be for cellphone data plans, which as I understand it, unfortunately aren't covered by current Net Neutrality rules (though they should be).
I don't think this is illegal.  It does not restrict access to content.  It does not throttle loading times (in fact it may improve it if you are constantly downloading less information) and many people would appreciate this lower cost option to enjoy videos they don't have to artistically critique.

It would be illegal if this quality applied to CERTAIN sites.... which I'm sure they will start doing once NN is revoked.

Looks the same as in early October 
Little late lol been known for few months now.

Lets start worrying when IPS start fucking with your home service Mobile market has always been shitshow like unlimited data throttling *to pint unusable* after 20gb BS..ect
You are overreacting. Why you need 4 lines? 
Maybe this is the same as the Portugal thing, you misunderstood.
600kbps?! That's hardly enough to use CompuServe!
Using your phone as router, how powerful can be a phone used as router.  
This makes me think that people don't even understand what they are fighting for. 
Most likely the amount of data you can use at any second. It's not limiting which providers you are able to.

130 Title: Just read this article in support of the repeal. What do yall think?Honestly I found this article as a joke as to some of their logic in this article basically one of their main arguments is why let a business censor unsavory content on their own domain, lets let bigger businesses control, who on multiple occasions have undermined their consumers, to censor everything.  Like they try to appease their base by saying "the left" when it all reality this a bipartisan issue, the majority agrees that net neutrality rules should be left alone, not to mention the fact that they use the idea that "Most people are far more worried that social media companies will block their content rather than Comcast or Verizon." is bloody ridiculous xD.  I've always been more worried about my ISP rather than my social media moderating me, and I'm pretty sure most people would completely agree
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131 Title: Switch carrier from Verizon to Sprint?It's still a bit early to determine who's doing what with NN, right now it seems all 4 major national carriers are hedging on their past NN positions.  Ultimately, it's doubtful any of the major wireless carriers going NN. No major carrier is going to be able to resist setting up sweetheart deals with selected content providers like Netflix & YT, because people buy brand names & content, not the abstract concept of NN.   Plus entry of the cable co's into wireless is going to further fragment the market, since they are closely associated with the cable TV content provider networks. We'll all have to watch the market carefully, perhaps a couple smart smaller MVNO will use NN to carve a niche market.  Maybe one of the big 4 will stake a position more neutral than the others.

Ultimately, I left VZW and moved to a TM MVNO (Wal Mart's Family Mobile) due to high costs & poor service, not NN. And I made sure I wasn't contractually locked in, so I could change if I was unhappy for any reason.   There are other worthwhile MVNO's worth your consideration as well, IMHO. 

That's probably not the answer you were looking for, but clearly NN is no longer an advantage, as none of the majors really cares about any concept other than sales numbers & market share, since that's what Wall Street & the shareholders focus upon.
Do research into the competition once everything starts to adapt to the new regulation.  Until then u/ispland is right... it is too soon to know.  I suspect that they will do as they've always done and work to create the illusion of competition while just offering the same service.  If they really want to create competition, they will do something substantially different from the others.
I'm considering to do the same, but wait a little bit. After the vote, I will check which one will support NN, but I guess no one. All of them want to make more money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
132 Title: The FCC seems to have companies and organizations promoting their plan to destroy the internet, paying twitter for the spotlight to fool those who aren't careful.That's ridiculous that they are managing to spin this in a positive way
That's all they can do. What's sad it so little even know what Net Neutrality means. Go outside and ask people how they feel about it. Even if they know a little, I bet a large portion don't know what 'Repeal T2' means.

Not one teenager could tell me what Net Neutrality was when I visited the local mall.
My in laws support getting rid of net neutrality saying that if any companies tried anything shady people would just switch companies. And that new companies would come in to take up the spots of companies that do things like throttle, essentially that capitalism would make this all work out. In theory, with something like McDonald or a clothing store I️ might agree. But I️ have 1 isp available to me, as do a lot of other people. New companies can’t get into this market, not the way it is now, plus this is a utility not a commodity.  
Imagine how shocked people will be who actually get fooled by this and are confused when their "faster, freer" networks are worse than ever.
That's some pure bs. It's time to stop.
The scary part is look at how many replies, shares and favorites it has 😓
twitter is full of sheep, heck, i'll admit when i used twitter i'd like and share stuff that sounded good without an ounce of research or thought. information overload is my biggest issue with twitter, that and lack of debate
They're bots. 
The whole FCC bullshit is mega shady. There lying to everyone to get their way.
My god that is such a massive lie!
#FuckFcc

Lmfao we are so fucked. You know what's the thing though? You guys do NOTHING to actually help people understand the issue. You have to DUMB IT DOWN. MORONS. WHEN I MEAN DUMB IT DOWN, I MEAN REALLY DUMB IT DOWN AND TRY TO GIVE A NON BIASED RESPONSE SO THEY ACTUALLY FUCKING TRUST YOU AND COME UP WITH IT THEMSELVES.
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING? IS SCREAMING CONSIDERED NON-BIASED AND DUMBED DOWN THESE DAYS?

No one should be given such power.
Get out out my sight propaganda machine. 
Pointing it out is good so that people are aware of these fake promoted ads.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
133 Title: Net neutrality repeal is more about Censorship and Control than it is about Greed.This FCC is also shredding the few remaining media ownership rules. You're not wrong.
I believe its more about greed. There are many reasons that point to why this is a "business funded venture", not a politically backed one. That it just going to be a terrible side-effect, but not the cancer that kills the man.
It is certain that ridding the U.S. of Net Neutrality provides a new avenue for ISPs to make more money by charging disproportionate prices depending on which particular services are bundled in.

However, saying this is more about censorship is pure conjecture. I don't even have to explain why (since that's the nature of conjecture)

You have no idea how not cool that shit is but I think you’re gonna be up to speed shortly.”

Yesterday&#039;s FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could&#039;ve imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself."

That kind of political pressure is what's needed. Pai is going to repeal NN and it's his HUGE deal. He's banking all his chips on it. 

Ben Cardin is one of my senators and he's on that list. 

You can guarantee that The FCC will be sued. The public opinion is against Pai and pro-NN, so sue and fight a delaying action. 

Raise Hell and anything's possible.

My Senators are not on here so I will be sending them a note.
As a note to everyone else that sees this comment, if your senator is not on this list. **Please** call and email them showing your support for Net Neutrality, emphasis that they should too.
Boy is this a step closer for us winning!?
do not say this until its we are absolutely sure that were winning this is only the beginning
Well the next step is for everyone to call their ISP and tell them that once this passes we will cancel our service.
don't tell them anything; if the repeal passes just cancel the service.
Why isn't congress stepping in? They can stop it.
Congress is dominantly Republican so they support the repeal. And yes, they may be bought off too.

Our only hope is the courts stepping in, which seems like a possibility given how Pai is trying to repeal even pre-net neutrality laws, which won't fly in the court's eyes.

140 Title: Where are groups like Anonymous when things like Net Neutrality are at stake?That is a good question.  I guess **technically** there is nothing illegal being done yet... so they may not feel like it is appropriate to intervene.  Although it would be nice if they could get us the emails that are supposed to be open to the public.
If Anonymous waits too long, they will miss their chance entirely.

Keep in mind that removing the restrictions on ISPs that Title II provided will fundamentally change who we are allowed to interact with, too. Pro internet freedom  and human rights groups have already pointed out that removing the classification directly affects who can interact, where they can interact, and how much they would have to PAY just to interact.
Oh, and for the record "Anonymous" is BS. Just a group that was created to make it look like we have some hope. Anyone can call themselves anonymous and say they're in the group since that is literally what it is. There is no leader, therefore those YouTube channels like "Anonymous Official" who claim they are some sort of leaders of the group are just edgy kids trying to act like they even have a grasp of what hacking is, or it can be the government playing with people since anonymous never seems to talk about the real issue but only superficial stuff. With that said, I'll go now :)
I'm anon and I just tracked you down /s
I'm a pentester myself, and i can tell you there is nothing they can do at the moment. No actions have been taken by the ISP yet.
Anonymous has only vaguely threatened various social justice problems that they perceive are problems as of late. The world needs more real heroes, not people hiding behind masks.
Probably because 4chan is counterculture, and don't like the idea of the government having anything to do with their shitposting

I've seen you around a lot on this sub, and I know how empathetic you are about the issue. I really hope that the odds are in our favor when it comes to the courts. Never give up my dudes, stay strong
Well Ajit Pai is ignoring the public, the FCC has bribed may senators and political figures already and they are probably willing to spend a bit more, and many more reasons
Sometimes you can't always be right when looking at statistics, for example the American revolution
Could you tell me where you got this info? I want to make a report about NN.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
143 Title: My senator’s response to me asking him to stand up for Net Neutrality is basically: Thanks for your input, but we aren’t going to listen, because you’re wrong. Thanks for nothing, Senator Lee!>Entreprenuers starting new businesses thrived before Title II regulations and will continue to flourish with more opportunities to innovate once those regulations are repealed.

This is the lie.

Since '95 entrepreneurs have been starting *DotCom* businesses that relied on the even playing field that existed before anybody figured out how to manipulate bandwidth (or wanted to.) The initial surge in the server/provider industry was aimed at providing the widest possible service to as many people as possible.

Today the server/provider industry is dominated by a few corporate entities and they are the only ones standing to gain from a non-neutral network. No entrepreneurs will be taking part in the proceeds. 

Senator Lee does not appear understand internet commerce or basic economics (or recent history.)

Frankly, I'm shocked that Senator Lee is competent to even pen a letter (but then he has aides to do that for him, and they prolly use spell check a lot.)
This must be a copy and paste for senators that oppose net neutrality because my senators Jeff flake and McCain both replied with the same exact responses as well. 
it's such a crooked lie to claim that Title II regulations are "heavy-handed" when all it did was prevent ISPs from discriminating in their content delivery.

144 Title: NO, you cannot keep Net Neutrality. You have no right to it.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access
The reality of every nation in this world is you only have the rights of which you are allowed to have.  In America, you get to decide what rights those are, who they apply to, and when depending on how much money you are willing to invest in your agenda.
I didn't know Ajit Pai had a Reddit account
I am sure he does, but he knows well enough to keep silent since he has been paid well and promised future opportunities.
[deleted]
Look at his account; it's new and he's only subscribed to net neutrality Subreddits.
there is truth in this post, morality and good and evil rarely play a role in politics, however, this subreddit is gonna downvote the heck out of you. i'm curious, do you support NN or not
You can downvote all you like but it will not change the reality that we are going to successfully kill Net Neutrality. A downvote does not have any monetary value whatsoever and does not give you a voice where it matters.
You're only partially correct 

You don't have a right to net neutrality 
However 
You do have a right to freedom of speech,  freedom of expression,  and freedom of press,  which is basically what net neutrality 
So either way 

Go back to ancapistan 
The reality of the world and the truth of every nation within our world is you only have the rights that you are allowed to have.  Meanwhile, your elected officials only listen to what our wallets have to say to them.  The cold hard truth is cash make me right.
I... 
Partially agree with this. 
Money does in fact "make the world". People in the higher ups are really the people who matter the most. Their word gets out more than the general public. But, we don't deserve Net Neutrality?
Too far, seriously. Getting rid of NN isn't just a way for companies to get money, but they then have the ability to control the internet, show what they want you to see, privacy on the internet is no longer. I could go on. There are very, very, very, miniscule amounts of people who would actually benefit from this. This will affect the majority of people heavily. Applying for jobs, college, finding our what's happening around the world, and so on. This isn't just some scheme for companies to earn money. This will affect the future of our world significantly for the wrong. And even if people get over it and start paying, they don't get what they paid for, at all. The scam that will forever change the nation. 

It doesn't matter what you think what matters is what the majority think and what makes the world go round is the people feeding the matrix and the matrix is changing for the better rather you like it or not deal with it. 
Despite the fact that this is probably a troll post, it has the ring of something the rich might actually believe. 

It seems like small selection of the stupidest rich, usually inherited, not earned, have this opinion. They forget that to keep the population complacent you need to provide them with cheap food and entertainment. Encroachment on the internet threatens that entertainment portion of the deal. The only reason people don't bother to look up their representation, to go out to ballot boxes, to start grass roots movements, is because they have easily available food and entertainment. 

I think that if this net neutrality issue is pushed too far, and suddenly large portions of the public can't afford to watch tons of youtube videos, or follow the kardashians or whatever it is that the average person is into we will see more people showing up on election day. We were close to it with Sanders, and this should push a large section of the population over the edge. It'll be interesting to see how the democracy swings.

146 Title: FCC won’t delay vote, says net neutrality supporters are “desperate”Any remnants of hope I had before hearing this are now gone. I guess not being able to pursue my dreams or even have any lucrative career are gone. 
This FCC will kill net neutrality. We'll see how the lawsuits that will happen turn out, but the best bet to have net neutrality again in the near future is a law passed by congress. That won't happen with this congress, so it's important to elect a lot of Democrats in 2018 and 2020. If they can get a majority of the Senate and we'll have a Democrat in the White House, net neutrality will become law again. It's super popular, even among Independents and Republican voters, it's a no-brainer for Democrats to pass this legislation when they're in control again.
There's always the lawsuit that's sure to follow once the vote takes place. That's going to be the next battleground.
Of course we are desperate. The end of net neutrality means that far less people will be able to talk to far away family and/or friends, and many will suffer. Why wouldn't we be desperate about keeping it?
honestly it seems HE is the desperate one. literally he is name calling right now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147 Title: Reddit, Google and whoever else that has the balls should shut their content off to raise awareness.Thumbs up!!!
If Google shut down for 3 days the vote wouldn't pass.
If Google shuts down for even one day half the country would be ground to a standstill.

152 Title: Emotional support neededSue the FCC for giving you anxiety attacks.
I've been having anxiety attacks and major stress coming off from this. Since nearly every class iv taken in high school has been technology/programming based.i wanted to go into the same field of work you are in.
I don’t even know anymore 
1. We can only speculate about the outcomes of the possible repeal of net neutrality.  Deal with the situation as it develops rather than focusing on the worst case scenario.

2. Web development will remain in demand even if net neutrality is repealed.  If it is repealed, that does not mean the internet will completely cease to exist.  ISP's as businesses require supply and demand of internet resources to remain relevant.
Your web development degree will still be very useful. You think people won't need websites built after these rules are repealed? Let's not go overboard.
Ive been screaming about this for years, but not because it impacts how i make my living; rather how it impacts society as a whole. I write algorithms that will be heavily impacted by throttling, but i dont see this harming my way of making a living. You have ti understand that net neutrality protects the speed and level of service that consumers/businesses will receive. Without it, premiums will need ti be paid, but just like oil, people dont stop driving when gas prices skyrocket... it just sucks and they adjust. People in the industry will need ti do the same. Also if you want to be dramatic you should think about how this will control information that reaches the school systems and hiw that will reshape our world... rather than how youll support your girlfriend. Buck up
me too man. Whatever happen, hope for the best, but expect the worst. Only with continuing protest can we change the tide.
Hey, same here. 
Everybody is unconsciously share both fake and real  news.  
Some fake news has been boosted and made double of what they really are (Like the Portugal one).  
Also if net neutrality will be repealed Internet will not disappear, if ISPs block social media they will know the worst riot ever and lose half of their users (for example in big cities where there's more than one ISP.
Keep on being positive and fight for net neutrality as you can.
Life gets tough but you just have to move on and adapt to the future.
All my dreams are being crushed I can’t just accept it

154 Title: When Net neutrality loses, how do you adapt?I don’t. I have no career path when this happens. My web development degree won’t mean shit. The prospect and virtue for success is dead. I can’t adapt to it.
I'm going to start studying Comp sci next year, and have so far learned coding through the internet.    
If I lose access to Stack overflow and a bunch of other helpful sites I'm going to be so mad.     
      
It's crazy that something so big it's likely to slow down the progress of the USA compared to the rest of the world significantly. Trying to learn stuff? Too bad. Trying to find a good job online? Too bad. Trying to start up your company? Too bad. Trying to get unbiased news? Too bad. Trying to order stuff online for a decent price? Too bad. Trying to spread news of a new scientific discovery online? Too bad. Trying to raise money for charity online? Too bad.   
>People have been talking about this for months, maybe even years

I remember first hearing about Net Neutrality in 2014, and later learning specifically what it is about in 2015 and onward. Judging by how this is going, I feel like this repeal of Net Neutrality has been a long time coming from big power players in politics and business. I don't believe in conspiracies, but things have gone so royally wrong and since been so ignored that it seems way, way unlikely that everything surrounding it is so...?? I don't even know the word. I feel like Trump is just the catalyst to all this.

I did read somewhere that the next president can swoop in and reinstate Net Neutrality "for good", it said, but I'm also a pessimist and fearing we'll have to deal with Trump for two terms -- and that's too long. The internet is too dynamic for American citizens to not be able to access it freely. Like, we need technology and the internet for our job purposes. Losing Net Neutrality won't "help the economy", but break it??

Some members of Congress have explained the repeal of the repeal itself, or whatever that wording was, and how it could stretch across to the Supreme Court and be what the 2018 elected peoples decide. So I am guessing the fight won't be over.

I feel so weak and powerless. I can't call due to hearing-related disabilities and my inability to properly articulate on the spot -- writing is my medium. I've posted time and time again to my Facebook, but my family's political motto, "We have to back the Party", and life motto, "That's life; we just have to accept what happens", is such BS that they don't understand the importance of standing up for these things they believe in and what will affect them.

I'm legit scared. I'm a blogger and a writer, and I depend on internet freedom for my career. I'm autistic, even. I'm not on benefits, because the process is so dehumanizing and biased that I don't even bother. I have been working myself nonstop to create a job around my needs and limitations, and I feel like the people representing me as a citizen are essentially saying, "It doesn't affect me, so I don't care."

gotjane, I understand what your going through and like you-I'm a writer myself. I write poetry and I'm planning to put together my first poetry book soon, I role play and chat with my BFF in the whole world on Deviantart each day, I watch anime and read manga online, I watch youtube videos, I listen to music on spotify. I even do research and keep contact with work and other places through email. I depend on Internet freedom very much along with fast speed. For my Library career and my writing career.

I have ADHD/Asperger's Syndrome (Soon to be official or not because I did tests yesterday-It's a mild case of autism). I work as a shelver 2 at my library and I live at home with my family and I have loans to pay off from college after I got my bachelor degree in library science. I tried to get benefits for my ADHD, but failed-BUT if my asperger's gets officialized, I can try again and if NEEDED-I'll fight to get the benefits because if I'm ever on my own, I don't know if I'll have a roof over my head or be able to live normally if I gotta pay paycheck to paycheck on stuff.

I know your scared, even I'm a little scared myself even Monique-BUT we shouldn't give up yet! We can't let despair get the best of us. If we let Despair win, then it's goodbye to not just our futures and dreams and our internet freedom, but for everyone else-Chaos and riots will break out, blood will be spilt.

I don't want that kind of future-not for me, my loved ones, my friends or anyone-NO MATTER the origin, the background, the places you were born, no matter the disabilities. I know-we maybe individuals on our own, BUT standing together and getting our voices across even if we have to push through and send a powerful punch in their corrupted faces-WE can't give up hope, we can't give up the fight! We can't throw the towel in just yet!

I don't understand much about politics or stuff, BUT I do know that if something precious close to your heart or that is part of life Like the rainforests in the world, then you have to fight to protect it no matter the cost. 

The government, FCC, Pai-THE CORRUPTED. They may not care, but perhaps we should FORCE them to care about us, WE SHOULD SHOW THEM what the People-The Free WHAT WERE CAPABLE of. Even the impossible can be Possible if you punch out IM and put your mind and heart and spirit into it!

Sure it maybe cheesy, I may sound crazy or foolish, but at least I'm making some good points! All of us are capable of incredible things if we just find the strength within to stand up and grip your fist to punch Despair and corruption in it's greedy an corrupt face!

It's time for a NEW American Revolution-The INTERNET REVOLUTION! We should keep trying to the very end to save what we treasure most and say that WE DID our best and fought with every fiber in our bodies! Be it through typed words, through words, through protests!

Even the most simple words can make a powerful impact no matter the format or way it's typed/written out. 

We can't give up now. We gotta keep pushing forward and fight for the future of the Net Neutrality-FOR THE DIGITAL WORLD itself.

Do you really want to lose amazing sites? Do you want to lose contact with loved ones and friends? DO YOU WANT people to not see amazing cosplay or anything awesome people create or post funny stuff.

NO! I say the time has come to show THESE JERKS THAT WE ARE FORCE TO reckon with!
I posted a submission earlier.  I think the only option would be: let's see if their rhetoric comes to be.  That said, it all depends on ISPs **competing** therefore we must sue any ISP that has a local monopoly and get them to break into two competing companies.
Anarchy
The plan is to finish my degree and then if they don't reinstate net neutrality once they see their mistake, I will move to a different country.  I assume the big tech companies will not stay headquartered here so I will follow Google and others to the future best country in the world when this one goes to shit. 
My company began firing people last month.  We're replacing developers with lawyers  and contract negotiators.  Better to have more lawyers than new products in this great innovative new world we are moving into.

But the thing about the internet for a lot of people is that it's such a necessity. Public internet doesn't compare. People who have websites, we can't always rely on public internet to do what we need it to do -- and not everyone has access to it. It's the problem: Society is too reliant on technology (including the internet) today for public internet as a whole to work. The lot of us will inevitably have to comply.

In my area,
Spectrum is the only serious internet provider!
If you want anything I've single digit mbps you have to use spectrum!!!
So everyone has it...
Literally everyone I know has spectrum.
So all that the repeal will do is allow the isp to raise my rates to the stars...
Well hopefully these companies will be forced to break up and give you a true competition.  I may be trying to look on the bright side (which is incredibly hard), but if we cause **actual competition** between the ISPs, then removal of NN might actually be for the best.  It's a long road to get there though (and I wish they would just keep it as is so we wouldn't have to continue this war of attrition).

you bring up a pretty interesting point. but if what you say is true, why on earth did ATnT and Comcast let their news medias talk smack about Trump? it doesnt make any sense. and even if comcast and atnt shows much interest in republican agendas, its likely their way of getting a leverage into politics republicans, mostly trump, outlived their usefulness.

dont forget that those who say theyre for republican interest could be secretly aiding Hillary clinton, since trump could later be a hinderance to major corps

160 Title: Will the death of Net Neutrality affect me if my website is hosted on an EU server?All traffic going to or coming from America will be subject to the restrictions made by ISPs, should they choose to implement those restrictions. Traffic that never touched America will not be affected, but it’s possible under certain circumstances for packets to be routed through America even if neither the server nor the client are in America. I’ve heard that sometime UK clients will get packets sent to New York before being sent to mainland Europe, depending on the overall load on the English Channel data cables utilization.
So basically my EU clients will have no problems visiting my website but US and UK might? What about my google search rank? Will that be affected in any way? Might google start to discriminate slower sites?
Doesn't mean that there would be restrictions, but better keep net neutrality.

169 Title: Would not having net neutrality be like YouTube's demonitization of right views or anime?Can you rephrase the question? I don't really understand it, but I do have something to say about anime and net neutrality.
No not really YouTube basically just removed youtubers ad revenue by removing ads on videos that don't meet there family friendly standards (no swearing etc).  Youtubers now have to use alternatives such as patron to make a living now or stop creating videos for a living and do it as a hobby. 

Net neutrality if revoked will allow isp' s (internet service providers) to control how fast your internet speed, for example: want to watch YouTube videos in HD 1080p? Well unless you pay for a premium package they could say were going to limit you to 240p and they would be in  the right legally. 

They could also favor some websites over others say you start a small business well unless you pay the isp (like Comcast) they won't allow any of there customers to view your sight.

It's a scary dark road that basically offers the consumer NOTHING more than what we currently have but expects us to pay more for the SAME service and act like its a great development. 

Literally repealing net neutrality means you will have to PAY MORE for either equal or even more RESTRICTED content then you have now. 

Sucks right.  Only people who gain are the isp's (Verizon) and would you believe it an ex Verizon lawyer is the one pushing for the change.  Yea he's not in Verizon's pocket at alllllll. /s
Just because they turn off the law that force them to  not block, throttle or pay more doesn't force them to do it.  
If rob banks would be legal, you would do it?

180 Title: How should I reply to my Senator who sent me this response defending the FCC's decision to gut Net Neutrality?If was me I would send the following

"I respectfully suggest that you may be misinformed in the following points:

1. They (telecoms and ISPs) are both regulated the same because that is the best way to ensure that service providers don't limit the source of the information.  Without this regulation, we couldn't use the full advantage of these networks.

2.  These regulations do not restrict R&D within ISPs... that is fully up to the company on how they choose to reinvest their money.

3.  The government restrictions are not on the internet itself.  It is on the companies that are selling access to the internet.  Since most of these hold regional monopolies, the regulation is assuring that many Americans (like myself and possibly you) can continue to enjoy access to all information instead of depending on the priorities of companies.

If you can show that these claims are incorrect, I would appreciate some literature on the correction.  Until then, your email has only enlightened me that you don't do your own research and don't care that the people you are listening to have clear agendas.... and I cannot continue to vote for such a person."
Wow! Thank you! Very well stated. Do you mind if I use what you said to respond to the Senator?
I actually [JUST made a post about my Representative's response to my message](https://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/7hich2/how_much_truth_is_in_this_response_from_scott/), and I'm frankly in the same boat but agree that u/ntschaef 's response is a great one.  My main question was with Scott Perry's description of allowing ISP's the ability to manage network congestion.  Can't say that I'm familiar enough with the topic to know if this is a real concern, but I'm sure that breaking the internet into a multi-tiered product would NOT increase consumer choice and innovation.

>  "...the Order negatively impacts [an ISP's] ability to manage the flow of traffic through their limited networks. As network usage increases due to bandwidth-intensive applications, it's becoming increasingly necessary that ISPs find new strategies for handling this congestion."
::Deep sigh::  Unfortunately I believe he's right.  Much like North Korea, if you have less nodes to travel through then the overall traffic will be cut down.  So essentially he's saying "if you elect to get a package that only accesses facebook, then we no longer need to consider the ENTIRE internet and everything you do will be faster. This will also extend to everyone else because they won't compete with their traffic either."

I don't think restricting information is morally right.  But (with my current understanding of networks) it will make the internet more efficient.  But it's also a way that the ISPs can claim "see we made the internet faster" without spending any money or actually making a better product.
[https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard)

Like the site says, tweet & call him. And call, write & tweet the 'Unknowns'.

What he said doesn't make sense. How would it create more jobs if it winds up costing more jobs than it created? Is he specifically talking about one industry, broadband providers? They'll be able to steal jobs from internet companies that are being put out of business. Granted, some of those jobs might not be in the USA, but reversing what we have will stifle innovation on the internet.

Now what he stated about 'reclassified broadband internet' he is referring to internet service providers being called 'telecomunications services' instead of 'information services' - picture AOL as an information service, where they regulated your internet, but also gave you local chat channels to meet new people, isp's aren't that, Ajit Pai wants to make them one. [A better explanation](https://youtu.be/cSZQc3_2RZ4?t=2m26s) and [more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtOLhoxCpzE) to add the letter. It took years to put the current rules in place, but they're going to be reversed in an instant.
I also received this response from Pat Toomey. I'm glad to see that there are a good few people in PA speaking up with me. I contacted him again letting him know that he will not have my vote on re-election, and that net neutrality is not hindering innovation at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
181 Title: Legitimate reasons to support the repeal of net neutralityNet Neutrality protects consumers and creators of/in the internet by mandating that all information be treated equally. There is no reason that this should not be the case. The only point you made where this would not work better than anything else is about self driving cars getting priority access to the internet. However you're wrong there too. Self driving cars are just that. Self driving. They won't, nor should they, need access to the internet to function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
182 Title: Shouldn't everyone immediately cancel their service?No way this is happening, not enough people know whats going on.

Because more people know who Mark Cuban is. If Taylor Swift made a video about Net Neutrality it would get over a million views within an hour.
I just contributed to that count, but the rhetoric of his explanation peppered with random jargon made me sick.
Mirror?
Lol. “A network error occurred” yea... right
Ron Wyden defends Net Neutrality. He is also one of the most prominent opponents of government censorship and surveillance. How could this be, if proponents of Net Neutrality just want more government control of the Internet? It doesn't make sense. 
You have to understand Comcast, at&t, and Verizon is in bed with a good portion of the house and Senate. You can see that by looking at who Ajit Pai is,  former lobbyist and lawyer for Verizon.
  If one of those senators wants a website or news organization censored it will happen.  Net neutrality protects against censorship of the internet by these big ISPs.
cant upvote this enough

Whether we win or lose the vote, we know we will be right back here in another few years with ISPs, yet again, trying to control the internet.

192 Title: How much truth is in this response from Scott Perry, PA 4th District?if they need to throttle bandwidth they can do it for all traffic equally.  The issue is when they are allowed to choose specifically which traffic to throttle.
Can anyone explain, especially the following quote, if any of this is true?

> "...the Order negatively impacts [an ISP's] ability to manage the flow of traffic through their limited networks. As network usage increases due to bandwidth-intensive applications, it's becoming increasingly necessary that ISPs find new strategies for handling this congestion."

If we were to compare the average bandwidth needs of a town 10 years ago, it would be drastically different than today, right?  So playing devil's advocate, if every resident in a town streamed 4K Netflix and were playing on XBox Live, is this network congestion a real issue with our current networks?

I will add that I DO NOT agree with breaking internet service into a multi-tiered product, that it will lead to LESS consumer choice as certain customers would have to pick from various service packages.  Just wondering how much of that is bullshit.

Of course not.
It will, our ISP will look what happens now in US, and will try to do same with help of Big company loby. Serbia is not in EU, so it would be easier to break NetNeutrality here, than in EU.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
197 Title: Net Neutrality AnalogiesHighways.

Say there's a 10-lane highway. Everyone has to pay the same amount to access the highway. Normal, one-lane cars (normal bandwidth websites) only require one lane to drive down the highway. In come a fleet of trucks that carry loads of information and take up six lanes of highway (high-bandwidth websites, like streaming video). Suddenly, all normal traffic has to fit in the remaining four lanes.

Now, the high-bandwidth sites are suddenly taking up 60% of the highway, yet are still paying the same amount to access the highway as those only taking up one lane. This is causing occasional traffic jams in the other 40% of traffic because it is squeezed into fewer lanes, though it is infrequent because these cars didn't require much room in the first place.

However, the owner of the highway (ISP), with the increasing amount of high-bandwidth traffic, is noticing that the highway will need to be upgraded to add more lanes or else there will simply be too much traffic down the road (no pun intended) and we will start to see many more traffic jams. Because the high-bandwidth traffic is the culprit behind needing to increase the size of the highway, the owner wants the deliverers of that traffic to pay for the upgrades by charging them more to access the highway because they take up so much more room than the other drivers. 

Due to the current laws, however, the high-bandwidth providers don't have to pay more than everyone else, despite them using a much bigger portion of the roadway. Not being able to charge the content providers more money, the maintenance and upgrade costs of the highway have to come from somewhere else: the consumer who pays to access the content traveling down the highway. 
It's too long and aren't isp's supposed to treat each bit of data the same, not treat bandwidth as banks treat dollar bills? (If everyone took all of their money from the bank, there wouldn't be enough.) If they are having these issues that you've stated, why not keep it as is watch as speeds slow down?

In your analogy, nothing is stated of the trend of the internet, how the average amount of bandwidth used per year has been steadily on the rise and how the average speed of USA isp's rank somewhere around 25th in the world, but costs for that same isp service ranks in the top 5. For justification of consumers to the increased costs, competition is required, of which in the USA, there is none.

198 Title: Please help me improve my rebuttal in support of net neutrality.im worried about how bitcoin will operate in a closely censored internet. right now governments can only block sites they find malicious. since information is everywhere and way beyond their control as of now, the abolishemnt of neutrality would give fcc more judicial vaccume and to fill with propogated anti human conciousness reasons to shut services like the bitcoin network, tor cuircuit, limiting the capablity of vpns, etc. 

this is just one step toward the complete takeover of the internet by the powers keeping us yet conciously enslaved, curbing information they dont like us to have.

unlike blocking services actively right now, they would be able to validate services allowed to exist on the internet platform.
that there is a huge issue for the freedom of speech.

Very well thought out response. Nice
Good response and you are absolutely right, however I am pretty sure it will pass congress with Ajit Pai manipulating people and leading them to believe all the fake messages to the FCC through temporary emails in support of net neutrality will allow him to say its what majority wants, which is blatantly untrue.  The other thing is that you can see which senators came out with their stances on it and how they will be voting, and I just have to say from that, it doesn't look to good for us man.  Just try and send a message from battle for the net and make a call if you haven't already and want to see if you can help make a difference.

Yes, we still have a chance. When I say a chance I mean a very good chance. Browse around Reddit, you’ll see many posts providing nothing but fact on why it could/ would be won in court.

210 Title: My parents think net neutrality being repealed is a good thing because "the Internet isn't important"What the FCC is doing will make it harder for people tell the truth about war. Anyone who thinks that's ok is, ultimately, a victim of US propaganda. We need to free their minds! :)
Agreed!

I've always been a firm pacifist. 
My parents are cancelling cable AND internet if it's repealed which I support, but will also suck. Downloading as many YouTube videos as I can ATM lol.
I'm fortunate enough to live in the UK so it won't affect me directly if it's repealed, but I still think it's bad for the rest of the world.

Lot's of companies are American-based and I fear that if a place as big as America get's rid of net neutrality, it's only a matter of time before the rest of the world follows suit.
you can use public wifi, its good that the family is taking a stance, by boycotting. Protesting essentially does nothing, besides annoy the other side, and possible make them numb to your protests.
how do i do that, on windows yoga lenova if that helps
Sounds like your typical white trash midwestern parent baby boomers.
The internet is most definitely important! Anyone who says so is a moron and doesn’t know what they’re talking about. No, I’m not referring to sites like Reddit, YouTube, or any kind of social media. Colleges and high schools use internet for online classes, lectures, and most importantly, homework and exams. Most of my homework and some exams, my life time at college, have all been online. My professor even emailed both classes of hers telling us to fight for net neutrality. Being 21 years old and in this generation, the internet plays a HUGE role in my life as a student and hopefully future film director or editor. Please tell people this, especially your parents. That is completely absurd. We don’t live in their older generation anymore where internet was barely/not even existent. Adults need to realize this.

Edit: As a whole, the repeal of net neutrality will effect the education system and careers in a very, very bad way. How these braindead congressmen haven’t realized that is beyond me. You’d think someone is smart enough to say, “are you fucking stupid? That could badly effect everyone who has a job, are a student, or who work for all schools.”
Just completely absurd.
Many people rely on the internet for quick access to services, including government services. Particularly poor people. The internet is very important, not to mention, really nice to have.

Everything your parents say about the internet could be applied to the removal of free speech. I imagine they wouldn't be too pleased with that.

"Free speech isn't important, why can't you just think about your discontent with the government in your head and not speak about it? You don't *need* free speech. 'Normal people' aren't affected if we didn't have it and could just live without it."

The internet is the future of paper.
I think their opinion on the issue is more uncaring than anything.

They see the Internet as nothing more than a "convenience" despite how hard I've tried to tell them that a lot of people and businesses rely on it. I think they just don't see it as a cause worth fighting for. My dad said that "it isn't as big a problem as running out of food".
Small businesses would flourish? What the hell?

The internet has made small businesses turn into some of the biggest companies. Many small companies get their word out with google ads abd get products to users worldwide on amazon. Some small companies are exclusively on the internet.


Tbh, I kind of see where they're coming from(though I still strongly disagree). We live in a small town with a town centre that is honestly depressing with barely any good shops or small businesses. I've tried to tell them that the Internet has helped as many businesses as it has hurt and that the Internet is great for people who want to be self-employed on platforms like Youtube but they don't seem to understand just how big and important the Internet has become.
Do they happen to be devout christians?
No, but they are pretty old-fashioned. 

My step-mum in particular.
They do not understand you.  They believe in this world that existed between 1950 and 1995.  From leave t to beaver to full house.  They don’t understand that we are well on our way to being the matrix.  The fcc will repeal net neutrality.  But guess what.  The internet isn’t going anywhere.  Real world social tribes such as town halls and nation states and religious gatherings are becoming obsolete.  It sucks but things go back and forth.  When we get net neutrality back next time people like your parents and town halls and tribal mentality will be a distant memory.  Trump is their death rattle.  A last gasp.  Eventual nations will cease to exist and the earth will just be www.  Your parents understand their way is dying and so you will not convince them because in their eyes repealing net neutrality is one last ride at “the way things used to be”. Let em have it. The internet is stronger than these morons and will win in the end
You're smart. They're not. Not really their fault since they weren't born in our time but yeah.

I'm 22.
I'm assuming they are still using cable TV (ironically I've seen cable companies drop channels before because they couldn't reach and agreement which makes ending Net Neutrality scare me more). Also go to a library for research? While they aren't totally useless for that you can just find up to date information online in a matter of seconds or minutes vs going through several outdated books for many minutes if not s few hours to find the same thing (and probably a little outdated) that you could have found online.
Exactly, but they just don't seem to get that.

For some reason they seem to think convenience is a bad thing. They're convinced that we'll evolve to have no legs in the future because we'll be spending all of our time in front of the computer. No joke.
Yeah my dad and i have been going back and forth on it. He keeps on saying how a company like netflix should pay more to an isp just for connecting to that, but the thing is that sure it takes up a little more bandwidth, but i looked into it and i might be misremembering this so I’d advise you to do your own research as well and present it to your parents (although to be honest it sounds like they are indifferent) but look at it like this. If you can do good deal of research on the internet and find multiple sources confirming one or two reasons and/or a bunch of reputable sources providing significant evidence that we need net neutrality then it might show how much you can find out online and show to them the importance of a free and open internet where these isps aren’t preventing you from finding all the anti consumer practices they have.

211 Title: This AnCap fails (horribly) to explain why Net Neutrality is a bad thing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
212 Title: Something I hadn't thought about.do not worry.... wait until after it gets repealed...we will riot...
Would the websites you visit actually show up on your internet bill? Like, my history bar is huge, would that really be sent over for my entire family?
Lol no, but sites you visit could be blocked. But it is possible for your family to view you're history off their router if it's advanced enough and if they know how.

213 Title: EA: The Phantom Menace (with a surprising twist)The intent is to give veteran Battlefront 2 players PTSD by using mostly original Battlefront 2 footage and using the song of a comparably iconic movie to bring satisfaction and smug grins to bystanders.

(also featuring the dramatic reveal of a secret villain)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
214 Title: SPOILERS Pai's plan will fail and have harsh consequences for Congress.That might be true but that scenario becomes more likely the more noise we make. Ashit Pai might not care about our comments but a court might later on.
Definitely will help but courts can be bribed at times. Though they ruled positively twice already. 
And political pressure too.

But beyond that the FCC is also oversteping its legal grounds. IT can dictate whether internet is title 1 or 2 but it cannot force states to comply and not make their own changes. And the rules he set up cleraly ARE trying just that.

Which would mean asshats losing political power. 
I really hope you're right. I've been depressed about this whole situation, and the courts are whats giving me hope and staying optimistic. Stay strong people! We must keep NN!!
Ashit pais plan is like this :after every sentence, you have to pay the federal government 5$ for use of free speech.
Which court will it go to? Directly to DC Appeals?
If it gets bad enough I anticipate there being a Supreme Court case.

FCC vs Net Neutrality/Ajit Pai vs Net Neutrality when?
Wishful thinking my man wishful thinking I pray all I could do is pray a protest that’s all I can do it all I have and will very little hope I have left

216 Title: haven't been on reddit in a week when did this happen glad reddit is supporting net neutralityThis one little logo switch really helps put into perspective how this probably won’t affect Americans only. 

Also, no Reddit in a week? I hope you are feeling okay!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
217 Title: Will the Repeal of Net Neutrality become what the internet is like in China?Yes, but a better example is to look at Portugal's internet; it is all basically split up into video game 'dlc' but you have to pay for EACH. MONTHLY. 
jesus christ. Is it guaranteed that the ISP will give you the full content displayed on the webpages or are they still censored to a certain degree? 
No.

China is doing it for ***political*** reasons which puts natural limits on what they do.

American ISP's will be doing it for ***monetary*** reasons which means there will be ***no*** limits on what they do.
damn
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
218 Title: Do Trump voters want Net Neutrality repealed? (not trying to be a smart ass either)As a trump supporter myself I don't want it gone, but it seems like most of us are more concerned with being good republican than improving the country. 
As a Trump supporter, this entire thing with taking away our freedom of internet disgusts me.
Im not a Trump voter but I feel that this issue is very bipartisan. Most of the people who don't like net neutrality are likely in the pockets of the ISPs.  
To be fair the repealing net neutrality thing was more Ajit Pai and the other telecomm industry leaders' idea than Trump's.

Trump just kind of nodded his head at it.
Not Trump, per se. Trump is incapable of understanding what Net Neutrality is or is about.

It's the GOP.  

The GOP installed Ajit Pai (Mitch McConnell, in particular), Michael O'Rielly and Brendan Carr in the FCC.
As a FORMER supporter as the the news with NN. I am disgusted... By the fact he appointed that guy for points with foreign citizens, and the fact is doing nothing to stop it. Ill vote when his term is up. But defiantly NOT for him. THANKS TO HIS FCC CHAIRMAN. I won't be able to graduate when NN is repealed because my school is online, and we already pay for it... God i hope we don't lose the house because our bills are mostly online ;-;
I just think Trump is better than Hillary. I am disgusted by this, but Hillary could possibly start World War 3 (or a war with Russia). I think both are terrible but Trump is better.
No. Most don’t
As someone who voted for trump because it was lose, lose anyway which shit stinks a little less NO! I support our open internet, I'm not a republican nor democrat but it disgusts me how this could pass congress. Three people on the FCC can ruin the internet for millions and all we can do is count down the days...I pray congress to intervene, they have to power for this not to become a law. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
219 Title: My State Representative’s survey. He’s trying the ‘Obama=bad’ approach now.Great. So he's outright ***lying*** to his constituents to drum up justifications for pushing his own agenda under the cloak of doing it on their behalf.

That should be an impeachable offense.
Fuck you, Mike Bost. First you sell us out for less than $30,000 and now you’re pulling the “lol obummer dun fukked up da inturrnet” bullshit? Obama was and always will be a far better president than Trump. Get your head out of your ass, you ugly piece of shit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
220 Title: I met a nearly perfect woman. But...You should try to convince her otherwise and if that doesn't work kill her.
I just killed her. I'm dating Jessica Rosenworcel now.
She's entitled to her opinion.  To this extent, just because she doesn't have the same view points as a large majority, that shouldn't reflect her as a person.
Well that depends. What was her reasoning?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
221 Title: What happens if NN gets repealed?Mass boycott of all ISPs
I have a better idea - drop the words 'of all ISPs' from that statement.

Mass boycott.  As in end spending for things that aren't essentially to keeping you alive.  I'd like to see organized mass bank and ATM withdrawals as well.  Keep the cash at home.  Bonus points for following up with selling any stock you might own.
You're damn right we keep fighting for it. We continue to make votes for it, forever and ever, and ever and ever. If we do not get the vote back, there will be a mass boycott. A boycott of which the world would never see coming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
222 Title: An opposing view to net neutralityA rebuttal: 

1.) yes, there was a problem. Comcast and AT&T had already begun throttling Netflix and gaming networks. Some ISPs were also redirecting your internet searches to websites that paid them to intercept your searches.

2.) Its an old law with applications to current technology. I don’t see how it’s a legal loop hole. 

3.) censorship is always an uphill battle and FB and Google should be looked into for any censorship that violates a law. But the ISPs were also guilty of censorship pre-bet neutrality. Just because one group does it doesn’t mean the other should be able to. And if you don’t like google or Facebook you ACTUALLY have a choice in using their services. You do not typically have a choice when choosing an internet provider because of monopolies that were granted so that ISPs would install networks everywhere in cities, instead of just in rich and middle income neighborhoods.

4.) the claim that it stifles investment and innovation is an outright lie and falsehood. Isps were asked if net neutrality rules slowed or affected their investment in new infrastructure during shareholder meetings where companies are not allowed to provide false information. The answer was always that net neutrality rules did not affect their investment in future projects.

Also, if you unregulated the ISPs then they get to pick winners and losers. They get to decide which video streaming service you watch. If they have their own service they can make other services unusable. 

Once they repeal net neutrality mom and pop ISPs aren’t going to magically pop up all over the country. Google a massive corporation with unlimited resources has been trying to create its own ISP for over a decade. But every city they try and enter they are blocked by ISPs with lawsuits. Cities where they do gain entry ttypically see an overnight decrease in prices and an increase in customer speeds. The funny thing is the ISPs typically roll out these new speeds with no real investment or changes to their networks.

5.) this one is just the most absurd argument. ISPs are given tons of government money and tax breaks to build their networks. Yet they routinely block other ISPs from forming in their own back yard. 

And you pay the ISP for access to the internet, why should they get to choose what you see and do? Why do they get to pick what services work on their network? None of this is meant to help the consumer, it’s meant to bilk as much money as possible from the American public for their share holders. 

I’ll post other links in the comments.
Government invested 200 billion in fiber network in the 90s.
https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion/
Most people only have access to one ISP: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/us-broadband-still-no-isp-choice-for-many-especially-at-higher-speeds/

Here are some instances of ISPs of causing problems that led to NN being introduced:

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

223 Title: We're almost 10 days to the big day.Ugh I feel like I’m gonna puke.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
224 Title: Important: I'm close to give up the fight. Too many lies.What are you doing here Ajit
I support net neutrality and is bad taste joke.
You are using lies for suport something people need, I don't stand this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
225 Title: FCC's net neutrality repeal sparks backlashSome messages of a positive note near the end but the courts saving net neutrality should only be relied upon at ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
226 Title: If say Net Neutrality was decided to be repealed. What are the ramifications that can and will occur in 6 months down the road? 1 year? 5 years? Etc. ThanksI don’t want to pay Verizon to watch pornhub, 

Pros

-ISPs are able to control data far more heavily

Cons

-The fundamental nature of the internet is jeopardized

-ISPs can legally censor information

-ISPs can legally disrupt and force competition out of business by throttling/denying internet access

-ISPs can charge additional fees in order to access specific websites and services

-ISPs can greatly limit access to the internet as a whole

-Education, Healthcare, Social Media, etc suffer greatly

-Major websites and services may have quality greatly decreased, if they are not put completely under, due to potential fees and costs placed upon them, or possible throttling/denial of access at the hands of ISPs

-Quality of life across the board drops if these fees and practices become standard

-All effects that occur in the US have a chance to spread to other countries

Essentially, its a huge upset to the very fundamental nature of the internet, and it can potentially turn the internet as a whole into a husk of what it currently is (and open-access information highway) not only in the United States, but all around the world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
227 Title: Got a reply from my Representative about Net Neutrality, thoughts? (Barbara Comstock - (R) Virginia)Very well researched and written! I am bookmarking this.


It might help to explicitly state that given past trends, there is no reason to believe that the minor drop in investment in 2015 was caused by the title II resolution. However, corporations have vested interests in saying so to representatives while denying this to investors. See https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/title-ii-hasnt-hurt-network-investment-according-to-the-isps-themselves/


To address your point 3, individual consumers and small businesses do not have the resources to fight case by case anti consumerist activities. 
For example see https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/atandt-lifts-facetime-restrictions-on-apple-iphones/2012/11/08/cbec36de-29de-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_blog.html?utm_term=.e9c10fd0c015. Apple has an army of lawyers to fight such issues in court. Individuals and smaller businesses don't.
> Here are mine:

> 1. Title II hasn't seemed to of hurt ISPs. A loss of $3.6 billion over 2 years is not that much, considering that ISPs invested $78 billion in 2014, $75 billion in 2015, and $75 billion in 2016. Seems like a 4% drop in investment isn't uncommon.

If I may point your attention to the real elephant in the room...

First off, note that in those USTelecom graphs, they start from the year ***1996***.

Note that in later USTelecom briefs, ***THEY DO NOT***  — They start from 2006.

[Broadband Investment Continued Trending Down in 2016](https://www.ustelecom.org/sites/default/files/Broadband%20Investment%20Trending%20Down%20in%202016%20Final.pdf) (PDF, Chart 1, Pg. 2)

Second off, note that capital expenditures dropped from an all-time high of $118 Billion in 2000 (under Title II) to $111 Billion in 2001 (under Title II) and then \**BAM!*\* a mere $72 and $57 Billion ***RIGHT WHEN THEY WERE MOVED FROM TITLE II => TITLE I.*** 

Read another way:

* In 2001, the year ***before*** Title I ***de-***regulation was implemented, when they already knew it was a foregone conclusion, capital expenditures had already *begun* to tank.
* In 2003, the year ***after*** Title I was passed, expenditures had fallen down to 1996-levels. Yet the Internet was wildly exploding as never before.
* Under Title I (2002 to 2015), capital expenditures have barely creeped back up to barely half of what they were, when they were under Title II regulation.

So, no, Title II regulation DID NOT ***cause*** a reduction in capital expenditures. In actual, undeniable, *provable* **FACT**, Title II regulation witnessed *greater* capital expenditures during the Internet's explosive growth and TITLE I ***caused*** a ***reduction*** in capital expenditures.

---
To wit, you're being fucking ***LIED TO***, folks. ;)
She gets it wrong from line 1,

> Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns regarding **the governance of the internet.** This topic is sometimes referred to as net neutrality or an open internet.

Net Neutrality has nothing to do with Internet *governance* and the very fact she portrays it that way proves she doesn't know what she's talking about.
I would like to hear the contrary sources of what she is talking about.
Here is the thing if we knew for a fact that the ISP’s did intend to innovate and compete with each other this reps argument would have some weight. But we know for a fact that they don’t. They focus on staying out of each others way and as a result people only have access to one or if they’re lucky two isp’s.

229 Title: I have a fairly popular website. How can I help?Thank you, so what you can do is make sure as many people are aware what net neutrality is and what will happen if the FCC repeals it, once again thank you for offering a hand in this, good luck.
Give them links to petitions and tell them about how net neutrality ending will affect them. Please include this link: http://www.rallylist.com and tell them to look for protest's for net neutrality. Thank you for spreading the need for net neutrality.
Find a bunch of links to net neutrality petitions and such. Also give them the whole scoop on what NN is, why it's important, what will happen if it is gutted, etc
As a content provider with 4,000 hits a day, just imagine if Comcast arbitrarily decided ***your*** website was just "too popular" with Comcast's 25,500,000 subscribers and if you wanted to get unfettered access to them you now need to pay Comcast a fee?

* And if AT&T arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 3.8 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Verizon arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 5 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Frontier arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 4.8 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Cox arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 3.5 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Charter arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 3.65 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Altice arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 4 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Mediacom arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 1.2 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if CenturyLink arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 6 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if Windstream arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* 1.1 million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?
* And if ***TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER U.S. ISP's*** arbitrarily decided if you want unfettered access to *their* x.x million subscribers you had to pay *them* a fee?

And then, of course, other countries tend follow the U.S. Internet lead, so,

* All of the ISP's in the UK arbitrarily decide if you want unfettered access to *their* x.x million subscribers you now have to pay each and every one of *them* a fee.
* All of the ISP's in Australia and New Zealand arbitrarily decide if you want unfettered access to *their* x.x million subscribers you now have to pay each and every one of *them* a fee.
* All of the ISP's in France arbitrarily decide if you want unfettered access to *their* x.x million subscribers you now have to pay each and every one of *them* a fee.
* All of the ISP's in Japan arbitrarily decide if you want unfettered access to *their* x.x million subscribers you now have to pay each and every one of *them* a fee.
* Repeat, ad nauseum

Scary, innit?

#That's just a single facet of the kind of shit Net Neutrality prohibits.

Very, very literally, each and every ISP can hold the entire world hostage without Net Neutrality Principles.

231 Title: Will Net Neutrality affect the rest of the world as well and if yes what can I do as a non-american citizen to prevent this?yes. https://now.justicedemocrats.com/petition/netneutrality 

need 20k+ more simple signatures to stop the repeal of net neutrality
There was a petition two weeks ago that completed a goal four times the size in less than a day. I'll let that speak for itself about how Americans feel about NN repeals.
They are not going to be able to do shit to stop the repeal of Net Neutrality.

> By signing this petition, I consent to receiving emails from Justice Democrats. 

One Mailinator, comin' up!
Without Net Neutrality, it will be significantly harder to combat the lies our government and the corporate news tell to get us into war. This means significantly more people will be bombed and killed, all over the world. Men, women, and especially children. Without a fair internet (and especially combined with the vote the FCC made a few weeks ago deregulating media ownership), what little chance we had of standing up to war and corruption is being flushed down the toilet, and that will DEFINITELY effect the rest of the world... Because it make it much more likely that my country will be bombing it. 
It will. I live in Canada and most of our data is travelling through US. ISPs here will probably have to pay ISPs in US to access their highways which will most likely increase the price of the internet for us. We also might experience slower speeds for certain websites who won't pay ISPs in the US. The number of users in the net will obviously decrease, that means less people to connect with. Twitch will have less viewers, steam will have less gamers, reddit will have less redditors, etc. If I couldn't pay for my internet, I wouldn't be able to answer your question here.
Theres a lot of factors the can affect you as a non-american, I could go on and on but you get the idea. This is a huge leap towards stone age. 
The biggest thing is these ISP, comast, verizon, TWC, COX, and at&t WILL be able to censor sites they dont agree with, any sites thats in direct competition, expect it to be blocked or throttled.
-A fall out for the repeal is that, USA, will set a precedence, that other country will follow, its a good idea for thier countries to drop NN altogether. An example would be S.korea, though they are touted to have the best/fastest internet speed, On thier conservative side, they managed to make a agency similar to FCC, it also allows to censor anti-government, anti-north korea rhetoric on the web, and other websites.

I understand everyone's frustration, but I'm certain they're not the only ones behind the pledges. So, don't completely burden them for it, also focus on their executives/management teams.
The posts title says "the faces behind all the money *shouldn't be left out either* . Don't worry about the all blame being shift on these fools that started this mess, we are all aware it takes two to tango. But the ones that start the song, and lead the dance are especially responsible for their actions. 
Fuck them. 
Everyone please vote against the repeal. If you struggle talking to people, you can go to websites and have your metaphorical voice heard. Places like commoncause.org or battle for the net.com. Help fight for our internet!

240 Title: Not my representative, got the survey by mistake. Rep. Darrin LaHood (R-IL 18th district) obviously trying to skew public opinion.Email content:


The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that it will be voting in mid-December on whether to roll back the 2015 net neutrality rule. This rule reclassified broadband internet as a public utility, subjecting it to increased regulation from the FCC. This included the Federal government mandating how internet providers operate their business, set rates, or implement privacy controls, to name a few examples. 

Rolling back this rule would return the federal regulation of the internet back to pre-2015 levels, honoring a 1996 law to leave broadband internet "unfettered by Federal or State regulation." 

Do you support the FCC rolling back the 2015 rule? 

- Yes, government regulation wasn't needed before and will stifle innovation.

- Yes, government regulation is needed but this rule is too overreaching and heavy-handed.

- No, the government has a responsibility to regulate the internet.

Like me and many others we use the internet to do our schooling because we are too far away from normal schools and busses won't pick us up or the school won't spend more money to have people from LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THEIR OWN LINE(since our mail box is across the street from their jurisdiction, they can't take us... Im serious. I can throw a rock to their line from my drive way. ).
Be sure to mention the fact that small businesses will also be negatively effected. Under Pai’s proposal anti-competitive behavior on the part of ISP’s will need to be litigated on a case by case basis. Larger companies like Apple, Google, or Amazon can afford this, but small startups can’t. Cite how Google had to sue AT&T in order to get AT&T to stop throttling facetime. 
Edit: sorry Apple sued AT&T not Google.
Will do
Also mention the fact that the larger ISP’s don’t compete with each other in practice so consumer choice is out the window as well.
Will do

I understand that perhaps a lot of them aren't that intelligent. It seems what will happen is if dailywire is put in the slow lane. He will attack democrats and tech giant companies for it. That's the only way they learn, but even then they won't say it's their fault if it happens to them.
He had absolutely no factual evidence to back up his claims. The same old “The internet was fine before Net Neutrality.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
251 Title: Another Way to Save Net NeutralityThis isn't bad

This is a good idea. How do we go forward with it?
We organize in our area first. Then try to find other net neutrality activist groups to work with. We call our representatives and senators. We tell them (if Democratic) not to support and budget if net neutrality is not preserved. We wil then need a script for cold call constitutants in other states with Democratic reps and senators. They will need to deliver a message to their reps and senators. In order to do this we will need call list of different districts. 
Good idea.

Great idea. 
Is it possible that this is already part of the Democrats plan to save it?
Don't count on it. The Democrats are weak. If we put pressure on them, they will be more likely to get net neutrality.
This might just work.

It is just rumor. I understand that sounds bad.

Maybe not to the point of saying they’re for net neutrality, but I can definitely see them spinning this. I’m not trying to undermine these protests, I’m simply asking if anyone has also heard this and if it is somehow true, what more can we do?

Sometimes when I try to open Twitter or reddit to view topics on net neutrality it won't load and I have to force close chrome and reopen for it to work, or turn off wifi and back on. Strange it's only on these two sites something to put in consideration.


Edit: iv seen videos on Twitter posted by mutliple people saying "you cannot view this video" or something along those lines when, they try to watch a video or play a gif.
There have been level 3 downages all week long.  Seems entirely plausible that ISP's are rebuilding their infrastructure to take advantage of this and give them the capability they will need to throttle certain traffic at will.  I would not be the least bit surprised.
Now that you mentioned it my ISP(which is TP link) is getting all screwy ever since the NN blowup recently. My phone data(Boost Mobile) works way better than my internet so that's saying something.

I don't know if people have talked about it, but thousands of jobs are at risk from this. Exspeically if streaming apps speeds are slowed down which I'm assuming will happen so you buy, you're isp's cable package (assuming they have one)
Internet will be pushed back to the stone age. People will have to create new protocols that are not similar to TCP/IP, and start creating new LAN networks with these. Bridges will have to be used to connect local area networks together, and servers using new protocols will have to be attached to these interlinked networks.

Found this article on the first page after typing, "upsides of ending net neutrality".  https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/19/these-are-the-arguments-against-net-neutrality-and-why-theyre-wrong/  I haven't read all the way through yet.  You should give your brain a break so that it can work & feel better; don't burn yourself out, bro.
Ajit is 100% just doing this for money. He doesn't care that it will completely destroy the internet
There is a lot of alarmist sentiment going on with it. The reality is they are not ending net neutrality, because net neutrality is a concept. And there is chances that even if it somehow got repealed, it can come back
The last major change to net neutrality came 2 year ago. Its what ajit wants to reverse.

But from what can be seen, there is only financial benefit to asshats like Verizon. They want to make up fast lane stuff, which would mean artificially throttling the internet connections, which are already some of the slowest in a developed country on earth. That is the end of it.

Mainly cause the regulations set forht in Title 2 utility is that the speed cannot be impaired. Everyone benefits from that. Even verizon. But corporates are dumb shits and destroy and exploit whatever they can.
Fortuantely the legality of the repeal is in jeopardy. FCC does not have the authority to override state rights and laws. That is somethign  that can only occur in Congress. 

Of course there is fear that this could lead to social issues. REpressing unwanted information, throttling online protests. Maybe even straight up orwellian shit. 
Honestly that is a far end.... IF sitll an issue. But an issue that exists even without net neutrality repeal. 
His whole argument is that it means it'll be a "free market" that allows competition to flourish, but the reality is that if it no longer is regulated the major corporations like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T can just buy out any competition, resulting in an even worse monopoly than we already have.

Free market is good most of the time, and people who support ending net neutrality imagine free market automatically means more competition and freedom in regards to who they can choose to get their internet provided by, but in reality this is one of the few scenarios where government regulation is absolutely necessary to avoid bias when it comes to internet service providers prioritizing some sites over others, which is absolutely going to come back to bite even the most hard right free market loving individual in the ass because such companies in general have already been trying to censor certain sites depending on which side of politics they're on.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/11/28/one-law-professors-overview-of-the-confusing-net-neutrality-debate/?tid=hybrid_collaborative_3_na-amp&utm_term=.439ba1c196cb


Do yourself a favor and read the part from the professor. 

From his twitter, @GusHurwitz
Law Professor at UNL College of Law
Co-Director, Space, Cyber, & Telecom Law Program
This is an argument that a friend presented to me:

>Despite the fact that there is a ton of propaganda and misinformation out there on this topic (such as the whole "packaged Internet deal that has never happened anywhere and is extremely unlikely to ever happen), has anyone else considered what else may happen if this passes? Things like if these regulations are removed and the cost of current ISPs increases, then it suddenly becomes possible and cost-effective for new ISPs to form, thus increasing competition? In most areas there is a monopoly when it comes to "fast" ISPs. Because of that, companies like Comcast are able to keep their prices just low enough and service just usable enough to prevent anyone else from being able to step in as a viable alternative. I think any changes to that will open the door to new providers, which they certainly don't want.

To preface, this is someone who's opinion I typically value and trust, especially in terms of technology, so I'm surprised at their anti-NN stance. I'm not posting this in order to make them look stupid by any means. I just want to hear your opinions on it.

I mean, I think this requires putting a lot of trust in ISPs to not engage in anti-competitive behavior which they already have a history of doing. That's like telling people to hate money. I also don't think that regulations are what's stifling competition in the current market. If anything it's the overbearing presence of ISP monopolies choking the market that's precluding any viable competition from rising. I mean, even Google can't seem to get Fiber off the ground in any meaningful way.

Looks real. It means they're on the defensive, in a court of law instead of the court or public opinion.
https://imgur.com/gallery/O93hl USE THIS LINK! People on imgur asked me to repost it with a different title I forgot I didn't put it on hidden. My bad.
So the FCC is actually going to court during the subjection of the vote?
That's what I kind of got out of it. I don't really know or if it's just the court asking for them to hault the vote kind of the reason I'm posting this. 
it would make sense. the rules of the repeal overshoots too many law hurdles. 
As I asked the first time you posted this, why are Tom Wheeler and Mignon Clyburn listed as defendants? I think this guy may have made the mistake of trying to bring the injunction against the Obama era FCC commissioners. 
So did he fuck up or is there still a chance this could go through lol
Ok, I am confused about this. 

What is it?
Everyone is, the guy who posted it didn't give much info besides say spread the news. I have no idea why previous FCC members are listed, but this guy seems very knowledgeable after looking at his books and Twitter.
Wait....with all this fake information being created on your behalf?

My first thought was check out this Kermit the frog looking mother fucker 
Who throws up at parties 
The turtle only moves for a quarter million dollars.  He has quite an appetite.
Smh at the Idaho senator who sold out his constituents for only $11k.  At least make them work for it, jeez.
[He should be careful not to choke.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4CUEhy81n3c)
Maybe now he can afford eyebrows, holy shit he's uncomfortable to look at.
he doesn't move; he lays on his back and takes all of it
Who is the highest? I’ve been trying to ignore all of them but he looks like the highest. Which would be strange because who cares about Kentucky? 
Fuck Mitch McConnell. That lousy piece of shit. Such a horrible person 
He has the most punchable face in the universe. 
Mitch is just proof that rednecks fuck turtles.  
That's an offensive statement. 

We fuck tortoises. 
Well, i think Mitch is in the dominant position, so rednecks like being fucked by turtles. 
Vote him out to /r/KeepOurNetFree!
More reasons than that to get rid of this guy. How does one state produce rand Paul and this trash?
That dude has one of the most slimy voting records of any senator in history. 
He used the system against Obama to obstruct and impede anything Obama wanted to do legislatively. Trump got into office he rewrote those rules so people couldn’t do exactly what he did. He’s a text book slime ball and America will be a lot better off the moment he steps down. 
I mean, it's Mitch McConnell... What did you expect?
As someone who lives in his state, I expect he’s plotting the cheapest way to kill all of us, and is making our lives miserable in the meantime.
Where does everyone get the figures for how much these telecom companies have paid politicians? I've seen several of these types of memes but no sources provided?
[This article](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale) is a good summary of the topic. The data is gathered from the [National Institute on Money in State Politics](https://www.followthemoney.org/).
He looks like the after photo of a skin graft on a burn victim
He looks way worse to be honest 
brilliant!

Along similar lines, kind of like [this guy.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/0/02/Mason_Verger_8.png/revision/latest?cb=20130822204008)
Turtles everywhere are cringing 
Where are people getting these numbers? Legit question
See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/7gv4u8/this_is_my_senator_he_sold_me_my_fellow/dqm4jje/).
He is definitely turtly enough for the turtle club
It’s a tie for first place r/punchablefaces with Mitch and Ted Cruz. 
I dunno man. Ajit Pai is giving em a run for their money. 
If americans are angry that their senators can be bought for under 100k maybe americans should stop protesting and do a kickstarter/go-fundme to buy their own politicians.
We already do pay them.... with our taxes
The issue is you'd have to do one every single time this issue comes up. It's come up several times over the past few years. And what about other issues? We'd have to pay for them to vote how we want too.

I get your point, and maybe an organization that lobbies politicians based on donations could be a viable short-term solution, but the real solution is to stop lobbying.

Now that I'm thinking about this, what if there's an organization whose main objective is to outlaw lobbying, and it does this by lobbying all the politicians to vote to outlaw it. I think some senators would go for it, if you give them a big enough one-time payment.
It's not a bad idea, but I think in long term rich people would win at the raising-money game because that is literally what distinguishes them.
Or make lobbying illegal and overturn citizens united because ppl cant compete with dollars And corporations are NOT ppl
That's what I'm confused about.. if these politicians were really bought for just this amount of money, surely it would have been easy to buy them out.. not that it makes it okay but there's quite a bit more to the story than this 
He's only been our senator since before Kentucky was an official state. Can't figure out why he keeps getting voted in. If there is a cap on the presidential election, there should be for ever government position. 
Your senator is a piece of shit. 
This dude has one of the dumbest faces I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of dumb faces.
Why is this turtle's mouth upside-down?
I mean yea he sold you out but apparently he had more tenacity than a lot of senators, i mean damn there waw a senator in jersey that flipped for 5k. 
That's even cheaper than one of the Louisiana senators that flipped for 6k. Guess they must have been desperate for campaign funds.
Can anyone tell me where you got this information? And what's currently going on? 
I’m scrolling through looking at all of these sell outs. You guys lose because he sold you out. But you win because this is the best fucking picture I’ve seen of a sell out.

My guys a sell out, too. We are all in this together. Sorry these guys are douchesnozzles.

Turtle needs his lettuce. 
Who did he sell his neck to?
Apperently it was a part of the deal where he sold his soul to the telecom monopolies 
Turtle turtle 
Damn you have the worst one
It's so tragic to see so many of these old white men generally who are completely out of touch with modern society, technology, culture, education, etc deciding the future of the nations for decades or even centuries. And they all do it for just couple of thousands of dollars. I would understand if they were making hundreds of millions of dollars. Then I could at least chalk it up to their greed. At this rate, its' not even greed. Who sells out his state and his people for as low as $6000. 
Sad turtle 
These geriatric pieces of shit... How are they still kicking? 
That’s a picture of a turtle

Join the nation wide protest on the 7th!

Is he not turtley enough for the turtle club?
I know he's called the turtle, but he looks like if Kermit never met Miss Piggy and made a long series of bad decisions 
He looks like a sad turkey. A sad turkey with a quarter of a million dollars! 
This piece of s*** looks just like what you would look like when you sold your soul to the devil
Punch able face

Kentucky needs to remind itself the recipe for turtle soup.
Lets boycott anyone who will hire Ajit Pai from this day on!
Just remember that when this rich, elitist asshole goes to get re-elected.  It's the only thing the public has left to fight back with!
Hi all, just wondering, did he get the $250,000 as a gift? No idea how this works.
Dam...3rd post for the turtle

$251K is the best I've seen so far, props to him for cashing in big.

Going to go hide in his turtle shell after all of this..
And these companies make billions.. can you imagine what kind of power you can buy with a million bucks if this guy is only 250k?
The day this piece of shit finally kicks the bucket I'm throwing a god damn party. Fuck Mitch McConnell.
Where do you find this info? 
I’m not surprised someone this goddamn ugly would fuck over the American people. 
He got the most out of the bunch but what an evil scum!
At least hes a expensive whore, some of the numbers ive sseen were really low. 

All these bastards that are in office and on the front page today for taking cash should never be allowed to run again, period.
Mine sold out for much less then that.

Call your congresscritters and tell them to protect Net Neutrality.

Hello my name is [NAME] from [CITY, STATE]. I am calling because I need [CONGRESS CRITTER] to protect net neutrality.

Please protect the jobs and businesses of [STATE] by telling the FCC to protect Net Neutrality.

Stop voting for him

Dude if I were him I can’t say I wouldn’t do everything in my power to keep people from seeing my face.
Wait...so like did they vote on net neutrality or something yesterday?
Does anyone know how Rand Paul stands on net neutrality? I'm not from Kentucky and I'm curious as to what his vote is/will be

Yet we keep voting for him....

At least Mitch-y boy got *paid*. Not like that schmuck from Louisiana who only got $1000.
Just gonna put this here 
 (202) 224-2499

He looks like a sad turtle...
Ajit Pai is very articulate and sensible in his arguments against Net Neutrality. 

Here is a quote of his criticism against Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent: "The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it's all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality."
This wiki copypasta disproves most of the echo chamber comments against Ajit Pai or for NN

Net Neutrality is a Silicon Valley corporate campaign against TeleCommunication companies control over pricing of ISP and data speed. 

Google/Facebook/Netflix and other websites vs. AT&T/Comcast/Verizon and other broadband. 

This does not affect the consumer in any significant way. NN is unnecessary regulation. The internet is not broken. Leave it alone. 
And please research and verify this on your own. 
(Notice that NN is heavily promoted on Reddit and other social media figures)
All emails at the bottom. https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact. 
At least he's the highest paid one of them all 
I hate his dumb face
He looks like one of the goblins from the old Hobbit cartoon.
so have you been banned from the Kentucky sub reddit?,  I'm not trolling, just curious
He looks like a whole turtle
Stop voting in old, white, men. 
Ugly ass 
Looks like a turtle, acts like a snake.
No matter what picture he's in he still looks like a snake
Is that Mitch McConnell?
As a fellow kentuckian struggling to exhibit the importance of this issue to my family, could you show some form of public documentation of This? I'd imagine it'll help them grasp the severity and corruption involved in this repeal
and here we see a republican senator in the wild, greedily trying to scam others with an impressive throat pouch display of dominance, but dont be fooled it is a bluff...
This man is second only to Donald Trump on my list of Americans I hate.
r/punchablefaces
He appears to be the head sellout Senator with $251,000.
Why does he look so much like the anchovies on spongebob
He looks like those meep meeps from spongebob
So what exactly is Telecom and why did they pay all these people? 
What did they gain from it? 
What do we do to stop it?
How long have they been working on this deal, I've never heard anything about it before?
What's a good subreddit to call?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSGS-KhT8Z4

But the corporations are the problem , not the government........ time to wake up.
All of the senators look their god damned baby boomers. They really are a greedy bunch. Literally selling away our future to their baby boomer friends.

Give us a fucking break!
Damn, he looks like a sweet old man.
I don’t know if I can blame him for a quarter million dollars.
Don't worry, I wouldn't vote for you either.
You’ve been downvoted yet for most people that is 5 years worth of working a job.

Are you kidding me? If you are that fed up with your representative, run for office or something. We don’t fucking kill people we disagree with politically in this country.
I'd sell you fags out for less. With the amount of bitching and self entitled attitudes no wonder some actually did sell out for less. 
Is this the official place you all come to share your same beliefs and hear nothing outside what you want to hear?

Congratulations on redditors ability to spam. Spam, lie, censor, etc. 

Not sure why you're discussing this when you are all little dictators yourselves. You ruin reddit, you lie, you spam, etc.

What can the government ever do that you guys don't do on your own?

Anyways I'm sure the coordinated attack by teenagers on Reddit who don't own their own cars, homes, are unemployed, etc. And act like Marxists will really change things. Good thing you're all lazy as shit and don't do anything but spam.
Hey. If you could kindly fuck off, that would be great. I’m blocking you so I don’t have to be exposed to your radioactive stupidity. Have a nice day.

272 Title: All the links to fight for neutrality.I used every link i could but there were some that people that dont live in the USA cant use/sign.
Sorry...
Signed all of them. Hopefully we can stop this before it is too late
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
273 Title: In light of net neutrality, we decided to open a free, no bullshit, no log, VPN service.Definitely keeping this in mind if neutrality is killed, thank you!
No problem :-)
Saving this for later, in case the worst happens. Thank you guys, is there any way I can donate to help your cause?
You can donate to us via Bitcoin or Litecoin.

PayPal is **not** accepted as they collect PII (personally identifiable information). 


I'll PM you the BTC and LTC address. It's also on our website on the About Us section. 
Hey, just letting you know, the download link for the Canada server is just throwing up code when I click on it.
It works for me.

You might be misunderstanding how it works. We provide you a .ovpn file that allows you to load it into the OpenVPN client. The client software is not made by us, however it's open source and almost every security expert will agree it's the best VPN software. 

[Download link for windows](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.4.4-I601.exe)

We'll clear up the confusion and add a tutorial on our website. 


 We are working on a custom client but our #1 priority atm is working on privacy & security.
What if instead of blacklisting servers that aren't in my plan, they whitelist servers that are. Then I can't connect to your VPN at all! VPN's are not the solution long term, proper government is. 
I would imagine VPN's would be the least of our concern if that was the case.

Luckily, this is unlikely. However, if big ISPs did start whitelisting, they would crash the economy and lose money.

Hopefully the repeal doesn't go through.
I have a question. Can the big companies still try to destroy you?

And it would be **EPIC** if this fused with Google company!
They could try. Since we don't do anything illegal, I don't think so. 

Google usually is the best at whatever they try to do -- adsense, youtube, search engines, adwords, etc. The catch is that whenever you use their service(s) they like to track and collect information about you. Due to this, we wouldn't partner with google even if they paid our server bills for us.
If net neutrality does go away, will this help?
It would if they started slowing sites they didn't like. We aren't big enough to cause enough attention so I think it will.

Let's say they block or slow down a site. (I'll use reddit for demonstration purposes)

To block reddit as an ISP, you can block it by not resolving the site at the DNS level, or not accept connections to reddit. When you connect to our VPN, instead of seeing reddit, they see a server in Canada or Moldova. Our VPN is also configured to connect to Quad9 DNS, which doesn't censor. (DNS.WATCH is used on the Moldova server, which doesn't censor either)
Moldova server?Hell yeah,Im in Romania in Iasi,very close to Moldova
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
274 Title: This'll get the attention of gamers:I think gamers are the most worried about this

I'd love it if people to shared this.

277 Title: AT&T BLOCKING LINUXDOCS.ORGJust because an overcharge of the net or the servers as can **always** happen doesn't mean that the apocalypse is begin.

Let's be stick to facts than unuseful an annoying allarmism.
Gateway: reset -- 
Computer: reset -- 
Cellphone: reset -- 
DNS on computer set to Google: 8.8.8.8 -- 
Attempt to connect to linuxdocs.org through both devices using gateway -- 
Result both cases: Timeout -- 
Go to free proxy website and enter linuxdocs.org web address -- 
Result: Almost instant connection -- 
Conclusion: ? -- 
Is AT&T is blocking routing to linuxdocs.org or is there another explanation? -- 
Why would AT&T block this website?  I don't know, good question. -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
278 Title: Does anyone care to answer some quick questions concerning net neutrality?1 and 2 im not sure, but I can answer 3. The repeal IS going to be passed. Its up to congress in court to either let it pass or shoot it down.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make our own Internet
How?
The 15th of December (the day after the vote) we will still be here picturing apocalyptic scenarios that doesn't exist.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
281 Title: we need a net neutrality act in the law of the USAhttps://twitter.com/Deeplyweb32/status/937167320987897860
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
282 Title: Internet blackoutIt might work
There were similar actions back in July(Day of Action), when major companies used battleforthenet.com widgets to express support for Net Neutrality, however I completely agree, a blackout would be extremely effective(I mention some similarities to this ruling & PIPA/SOPA here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9Fd8Hh-pTk). However, We have about 12 days left until the ruling. The best thing I think would be to call the commissioners, call representatives to pressure the FCC, and be another body at a protest to help garner it attention. 

There is a major protest being put together at the moment in /r/DC_FCC_Protest/ the day before the vote in front of the FCC building, and then the next day there will be protests right before the vote outside the building. I think similar to an "internet blackout", a 'Day of Protest' could be something that garners attention. 

Sorry for the long post, but here some more information the EFF just put out after their recent EFA call about some events going on: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/12/net-neutrality-needs-you-much-you-need-it

Even if this passes, the fight isn't over, but I think the major thing here is persistence and making sure we spread more awareness and facts about the issues at hand. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
283 Title: A plan for a decentralized, organic, neutral Internet.Yes, this needs to happen. One way or another I think it will, it's just a matter of time.  Hopefully the project gets the backing it needs.
Not a bad idea but more information about the backer and the team needs to be presented.

This is rather well-timed but where is the team behind this?
Security is such a major hurdle for this.
This needs to happen but we would need to make huge security advancements and 1 million is a lot of money to make in only 30 days. Really want to see this happen!

287 Title: The Innovation Enhancing Effects of Network Neutrality"Contrary to ISP’s claims that net neutrality regulations would have a chilling effect on their incentives to invest, we cannot dismiss the possibility of the opposite." (Choi & Kim, 2010)         
"The ISP adjusts capacity to the level of traffic: net neutrality is likely to favor innovation at the edges while hindering the development of applications from large content providers." (Reggiani & Valletti, 2012)

288 Title: Beign a non-US citizen, how can I help?I doubt you have the funds to lobby congress from across the seas, so nothing really.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
293 Title: Issues with ending net neutralityI don't think the effects of repealing net neutrality will crash the economy, but they will certainly not help any consumers or content providers such as Netflix. The FCC (or 3/5 of its leadership, at least) do not care. Ajit Pai is almost certainly being paid by Verizon and therefore does not have any interest in maintaining an open internet.
...Does it look good for the people who want open internet? 
Are we winning?
Oh, they realize it, I'm sure. They just dont give a shit, seeing as they have to pay people to support the repeal and make bots pot upport in peoples' name.

295 Title: Can r/NetNeutrality fact check this Rush Limbaugh article trashing Net Neutrality? How wrong is he?In general, I wouldn't put much faith behind anything Rush Limbaugh says. It's good to try to appreciate what people on all ends of the political spectrum believe, but certain sources are inherently untrustworthy because they have an incredibly obvious bias towards one political party or another. Every source is a little skewed, of course, but I would suggest you completely ignore the sites which have such an undeniable political leaning. Regardless, I'll touch on a few distortions of the truth he made in that article.

1) The example of a net neutrality analogy which he gives makes me think that he doesn't actually understand what NN is in the first place. It prevents ISPs from charging you more money for accessing particular websites (especially services of competing ISPs), but it does *not* in any way prevent ISPs from offering customers multiple plans of differing connection speeds. In this sense, websites on the internet are considered equal to everyone accessing them: consumers are not paying more money just to look at sites which ISPs do not like. To reiterate, net neutrality does not mean that the internet is completely free, nor does it even mean that it is the same price for everyone: it simply means that ISPs cannot discriminate based on the content you are viewing.

2) The government does not actually regulate the internet under net neutrality. NN protections disallow ISPs from distorting your connection in order to scrape more money out of your wallet. This "regulations=bad" mantra is a classic Republican talking point but is untrue and completely meaningless.

3) Net neutrality is not a new concept, as I have explained in a [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/netneutrality/comments/7gqi8h/help_me_explain/dql643k/) comment of mine. It has existed in the United States in some way since [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_promotes_freedom_without_regulation_(2004\)): this is not even close to a set of "Obama-era rules," considering George Bush was the president! As I pointed out on that thread, the FCC vote in 2015 simply reapplied net neutrality principles to Title II of the [Communications Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Act_of_1934#Structure) when they were *formerly* applied to Title I. NN is not based off of this exact legislation in any way and the FCC only applies its guidelines to Title II (broadband internet as a [common carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier)) as a means of enforcement.

I don't have the time to go through the rest of that article, but the examples I gave above are clear indications that Limbaugh either has no idea what net neutrality truly is, or is purposely misleading his audience into believing falsehoods in order to further his political agenda. I certainly wouldn't put it past him to be doing the latter.

296 Title: Emperor Ajit Pai of the FCC--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
297 Title: My congresswoman's Net Neutrality survey is unclear...Is the current net neutrality policy referring to what is in place now, or what's proposed? I should choose "It's good" right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
300 Title: Thoughts on this article? I know its old but i'd like to see yall's responses to his points.Don't take any of his points as true. Calling himself a "techie" like he is trying to use it and say "hey look at me like! Believe what I say because I'm a techie!" I read most of the article, but most of his points are false. Look at other countries with isp's that make you pay in packages. That all together should make you support net neutrality. I got the vibe he actually was paid even though he openly stated he wasn't. In the end we all know net neutrality needs to stay even Ajit Pai, but his greed sways his thinking.

303 Title: Any Wireless Carriers Pro Net Neutrality? x-post (r/KeepOurNetFree)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
304 Title: What do I put on my signs when I protest?It doesn’t have to be complex, actually it shouldn’t be. WE know what Net Neutrality and everything is, others don’t. So make it simple and to the point. Try something that makes people look, hint regular people only care when it’s about them. So when they see their situation is bad, they’ll pay attention. I’m not the most creative either, but i’m going to try something like “Another $50 on internet fees? Can’t wait.” Or “No PayWalls.” Hopefully I could help, you’ll do great man! 
Go FCC yourself?

305 Title: Help me out! Economics class, persuasive paper on net neutrality!!Actually you shouldn't trust Reddit neither.
Misinformation is here too, reposting true facts and rumors heard somewhere else. 
Econ major myself:

The first thing you have to do is clearly define net neutrality.  Thoroughly. 

Next outline economic arguments against net neutrality.  Such as: government regulations (in this case on isps) stunt innovation and competition. 

Argue each counterpoint from an economic perspective.  In the example above the obvious counterpoint is isps are making massive profits and releasing faster and faster internet to more and more people every year.  Competition is strong and innovation are even stronger.    Of course your paper proves this with financial figures from isps over last few years.  

Finally find other analogous govt rulings.  Is net neutrality similar to the govt regulation of a commodity like crude oil prices?  Why.  Why not?   Is net neutrality a service based regulation like airline compliance or banking?  Or is net neutrality like drug regulation?   There are a million arguments for govt regulations that protect consumers when they aren’t impeding on innovation and competition.  And some when even they are impeding those things.

For the crux of your argument:

I would argue that the internet is a utility.  I mean, ATT is a utility for goodness sakes.  So just like water or electric the government has the responsibility that all water and all electricity is filed out at the same quality, maybe not same rates, but same quality as everyone else.  That is net neutrality.  Govt isn’t regulating price, only quality of utility service.  You can’t charge people more money for cleaner water within one company.  But clean water in Miami may cost more than clean water in Dakota.  The govt still ensures everyone who pays gets he same clean water.  That’s net neutrality.
Thank god youre here sir. 
>I trust reddit more than news sites, can you blame me?

It sounds like you have an opinion and came to a website notorious for circle jerk behavior to confirm your own bias.

Does this quest for information mean visiting /r/socialism /t/the_donald, and every other radical reddit with biased opinions?

Go read the laws and proposed bills. Read the literal words of the people proposing the changes as well as the FCC's own documents from 2015.

There's your answer.

This is just you either A) asking someone else to do your homework. 

Or B) looking to confirm your own bias
yes, I am reading those as well.  These are some heavy charges huh, not just against me, but two other subreddits you're also irrelevantly enemies with!


but you are wrong, I truly don't have an opinion, cynics are prone to false assumptions.  Also, Reddit is a discussion board, this is Reddit's purpose, regardless of my homework.  You made the obvious point of me reading FCC documents, but only doing that robs me of discussion and debate.  The "I have heard" was a devil's advocate to generate discussion, don't be so obtuse.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
306 Title: Why didnt Comcast and Verizon block sites and cause the eventual hell before we had actual net neutrality?They hadn't established their own competitive brands for these websites yet. Now they want to kick the ladder out from behind themselves so that they cannot be overtaken by new, better services made by others. 
So basically, back then, if Comcast decided to fuck up their internet, everyone would just go to Verizon or just a smaller company that gives out internet the way it's supposed to be, but now (if net neutrality gets repealed), all the major ISPs will fuck up their internet and we cannot resort to other more morally correct ISPs? If so, why?
They didn't block sites because of the *threat* of net neutrality.

307 Title: I was banned from r/Alabama for posting this: This is my senator Richard Shelby. He sold me, my fellow Alabamians, and this nation to the telecom lobby for the price of $27,000.I was banned too for posting about Roby
Mostly liberals over in /r/Alabama, surprising you got banned for this. (I'm also banned from there.) All my upvotes!
Can someone shed some light on all this for me? I thought that only the FCC was handling this. Not every senator? Because they accepted telecom money for campaigning thats the "they sold out" label they are all getting now, thats what i'm assuming?
Where can we find out about our senators? I'm in Michigan and I want to find out the same. 
[here's a link to the verge article detailing each senator who sold out.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale)

What a cuck
Well, you're not wrong.
He got banned for being one of nearly a dozen sock puppet accounts.

Totally onboard with the post's sentiments. If he'd just posted the substantiating article, it would have been fine. Probably have 50 upvotes and a good discussion going by now.

That's a weak and speculative reason to ban someone, especially if it doesn't break any explicit rules. You guys just fire from the hip over there, it seems.

Why not just let the post stand on its own merit?

It's a comedic edit of his interview.
Isn't this a re-mix (kind of). He didn't actually say that, its just what he essentially said, without actually saying. 
This is so funny. Love it.
I used to be on the fence about net neutrality and then I saw Ajit Pai.

Immediately, I thought, "This asshole needs to be stopped."

312 Title: This is my Senator. He sold me and my fellow Texans to the telecom lobby for $40,840. Thanks Ted.Zodiac
#ZodiacDidNothingWrong
He looks like the rat that he is
I've met him in person. What's terrifying is that he's charming, amiable, and great at working a room. He's exactly the kind of guy you'd think "Yeah, he's the guy" about.

Except that he's an empty power grabbing shell of a person. His beliefs are all a sham to gain traction in deep red Texas, and it's worked great.
Hopefully everyone remembers to vote for Beto in the elections here in Texas. 
Much as I'd love to see that happen, I'm still going to laugh in your face for thinking it's possible.
Thought for a second this was Robbie Rotten.
It's not not Robbie Rotten...
I don't get some of these posts. Ted Cruz has always been against Net Neutrality since its inception. He didn't just suddenly sell Texas out; that's *always* been his stance.
Pretty sure the post doesn't specify that his position is new
Also look at his face tho lol

actually t he fcc has no power to do that. The FCC and similar do not have the power to redact or affect state law. IT would be illegal. 

The very fact he is TRYING to include that shows that he has no idea what his position is. 
yes but so far as I know the "protecting internet freedom act" Pai is attempting to pass through is also aimed at preventing states from setting up their own NN protections. fucking bastards!
Ajit is trying to prevent that. Which is honestly a massive overrach on the part of the FCC. They do not have the legal authority to do that though. 

Honestly its an aspect that may jeopardize his push. Gov is corrupt but the states don;t want to hand over power to the FCC or the Isps. Cause then they ahve less power.

319 Title: Boycott the internetThat sounds like a good idea in theory, but most people aren't going to stay off of the internet for a few weeks and expect net neutrality to come back. We have probablt lost this battle unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
320 Title: This is Secretary Hillary Clinton. She took $1,134,970 from the Telecom Lobby, and another $489,193 from Comcast in 2016.I don't care what ex-politicians think of net neutrality. I care about what the current politicians think (and how they vote).
Careful that is the future president you are talking about.
But as a US Senator, she co-sponsored the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2006 and 2007 to protect net neutrality.

This is reddit. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, they fell for bullshit propaganda and campaigned against their best ally for net neutrality, healthcare expansion, and cheap college education.
She supports Network Neutrality, and the telecoms support her anyway. Why is that?

The answer has to do with how Crony Capitalism works. These large incumbent oligarchs (Comcast, Verizon, ATT) need regulation to secure their positions in the market and stifle competition. They fund their would-be regulators so that the regulations can be catered to their competitive advantages. 

People look at the things Net Neutrality would prevent: paid fast lanes and what not. They see how Comcast would make a lot of money with these new lines of business available to them. 

I say to you that they don’t actually care all that much about the profits that would come from having no Network Neutrality, they are more worried about the losses they would endure because their customers would flock _in an instant_ to any competitor that would give them better services as a lower rate. 

They want Title II and an all-powerful FCC because this will be the only way they remain dominate in the market. They will use the FCC to keep their competitors stifled. 
She isn’t relevant anymore
Give it up dude.  She isn't even in the senate. 
She isn't even running for anything, relevant in any way or will be running every again yet people seem to be obsessed with her. I don't like her either but get tired of people bringing her up in any discussion dealing with today's issues.
She is the senate
[People want to believe in lies.](http://time.com/3721452/hillary-clinton-net-neutrality/)

Stop spreading misinformation. She was our best chance to save Net Neutrality, but people like you didn't care. 
Its not misinformation. Politicians operate by dividing people and telling each group what they want to hear.  She said she supported net neutrality but took money from lobbyists anyway.

Telecom lobbyists pay any politician from any party. Some politicians just cost more. 

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/money/4237383/hillary-clinton-big-cable-lobby-money

You’re operating under the assumption that the telecoms and large incumbent providers are against Net Neutrality regulation. If how they fund politics is any indication of their actual motives, then they favor it. 

Why is that, though? Crony Capitalism. This is how the Comcast’s of the world squash their competition, by colluding with their regulators and legislators.

322 Title: My speech on net neutrality possibly getting repealedthe time has come to start a revolution, to return this county to the people once and for all, we all need to untie to fight this, to fight for our freedom and the freedom of others, apart we're weak, but together we're stronger than they could ever hope to be, we are the ones with the power to change the tides, we're the ones with the power to save this county, WHO'S WITH ME.
Me
I'm not convinced that our elected officials, public functionaries, and large corporations truly believe they're doing the right thing here. Maybe at some distant point in the past they could've told themselves and the public that they believed their own reasons for acting against the public. Once but long ago; this is no longer the case. They know they're dishonest, they understand that they are the bad guys here, they know this will only benefit themselves and hurt everyone else; they just don't care. That apathy is why they'd so brazenly attempt to push this through and why every excuse to defend their selfish and evil behavior continues its degradation into the territory of paper-thin lies. Our only choice now is to remove them as they've all decided that selfishness is the crown of the virtues and their one and only obligation is to them and them alone. Be it reform or revolution we will attempt to regain our fate, the only question is if we'll succeed.

332 Title: This is my senator, Steve Daines. He sold out Montana's internet freedom for as little as $38,700.There's a lot of creepy-looking motherfuckers in politics, but this thing... goddamn.
Lol I know right. He wasn't even born in Montana he was born in fuckin California.
PENNYWISE?!

333 Title: The FCC asked for net neutrality opinions, then rejected most of themIf I recall, didn't they recently try to say that all the negative opinions were just a few bots/trolls? They are also guilty of comment fraud. Most of the positive comments submitted were stolen IDs of NYC citizens.
Do you have a source on this? I'd love to gather instances of the FCC doing shady shit to get the repeal to pass
Pretty sure this goes against the US Constitution 
You'd think the news organization like Vox who seeks to explain would.... explain how administrative procedure works.

Repeat after me.

The public comment period is not a democratic mechanism. The public comment period is not a democratic mechanism.

Public Comments are way to gather actual comments on the technical, legal, and practical implications of proposals. Telling the FCC you want ISPs to continue to be regulated under Title II doesn't cut it because you need add substance to the conversation. Even if you add a well researched comment, if it doesn't raise a new substantive issue or add new facts, it will be filed along with previous comments that basically repeats your point.

The idea is to explore the issues that may arise from a proposed rule from the people who know what they are talking about.

334 Title: This is my Senator. He sold me, my fellow Lazytownians, and this nation to the telecom loby for the price of $420,600I’m crying 😂😂😂😂😭😭

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
335 Title: This is Senator Roy Blunt. He sold me, my fellow Missourians, and this nation to the telecom lobby for $185,550.Good Lord, he is fucking hideous.
And this is with plastic surgery (no joke). 

He was once a school teacher, if you can believe it.

He did a lot for the area I grew up and pushed through a lot of grants to establish a research institution where I had my first real job. Even then, he and his family made out like bandits, but his work really did help a lot of people. I disagreed with him politically on, well, almost everything, but he did a lot for Missouri outside of STL and KC. I even voted for him as I was worried Kander wouldn't think about Missouri south of I-70. 

I was so fucking wrong. He and his have sold out Missouri and the nation. He's a fucking paragon of corruption; of a how a decent man can be so easily turned by so little over a sufficient length of time. 
Why is everyone posting these
Sort of a protest. Net neutrality WILL die on December 14th. So now we'll show everyone who not to vote for.
It's quagmire 
He looks exactly like the Grinch. 
Why is it that every senetor who is fucking us over seem to have the most punchable faces?
Good!!!! Net neutrality  needs to die it like the entire nation doesn't know how to read and is being brainwashed with fear tactics.

 As long and boring as the neutrality proposition is it clearly states that there will be NO clause to infringe companies to charge less or more for their services or that people will have to pay more to the ISP to see or have content displayed. 

THIS IS A COMPLETE FABRICATION. Remember 1996? well the net laws would be the same as they were back then before these major corporate  conglomerates  the proposition is in reference to relocating the title classification from II to I. 

people like the Young Turks and NBC are driving the wrong conclusions. How can they call themselves journalist when they are being bias and not reading the proposition in its entirety.

Net neutrality  is not a good thing for us. ISP are already throttling our services and giant tech heads are running the show. dropping Net neutrality  will allow a more open free internet anyone who thinks otherwise needs to read the proposal in its entirety. its plain english people. Don't be a sucker!

READING IS A GOOD THING!

Make sure to thoroughly vet the buyer to make sure it doesn't end up in the wrong hands. Last thing needed is some Project Veritas motherfuckers misdirecting people.
Hey, I may be interested in taking up this project. I also had another idea that I've been toying with, and it would basically be a version of google maps that would try to identify the business owner by their political affiliation.

341 Title: I see all these Senators who sold us out.It's a reminder to vote. 
The first battle is close to over. But the war has begun.
yes it does. on december 14th net neutrality WILL be repealed, and there's nothing we can do for it now. we'll have to wait and see if the repeal can be repealed. the phone calls to our senators didn't matter since most of them had a price to sell out their state which most of them did. we didn't do much at all really, a couple phone calls weren't going to do much. the only way to punish them now would be to not vote for them come time for re election of senators.
That's not necessarily true, the courts will still have the final say, and while they may have agendas as Well they are a final line of defense, but if we are going to stop this we can't continue the bashing. We have to win with arguments, not rhetoric. It's a bull shit proposal absolutely, but bullshit doesn't trump bullshit. We simply need to exhibit the consequences of these actions to the courts in a calm collected and reasonable manner. The fight is coming to an end but the war is raging on strong as ever. We haven't lost yet, that's just what they Want you to think. Let them In our heads and we are fucked.

345 Title: Did Donald Trump "haters" made Net Neutrality bigger just for use it as excuse for go against him? Because seem that Canada doesn't have any problem.A YouTube comment is not even close to a reliable source of information. If you want a brief summary of net neutrality in Canada, see the relevant [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_Canada). As the article and its sources clearly state, Canada's web is largely neutral. There have been a few instances throughout internet history where net neutrality guidelines were not followed, although this is equally common among major ISPs in the United States. The Canadian government has committed to protecting net neutrality in the future so I would expect to see more significant action being taken against such companies as time goes on.
**Net neutrality in Canada**

Net neutrality in Canada is a hotly debated issue. In Canada, Internet service providers (ISPs) generally provide Internet service in a neutral manner, some notable exceptions being Bell Canada's, Eastlink's, Shaw, and Rogers Hi-Speed Internet's throttling of certain protocols and Telus's censorship of a specific website critical of the company.

348 Title: Could The Repeal Net Neutrality Be Unconstitutional?But its the ISP doing it, even though laws allow them to throttle those websites. We have many laws that give private companies the ability to discriminate already I'm pretty sure.

You all are forgetting about FTC who deny ISPs from block and thrutthle.
I don't think so. Think of it this way, you don't have freedom of speech on private property. The owner can ask you to leave. He is not stopping your freedom of speech, but he is preventing you from getting your point to an audience. Same principle applies here.

350 Title: This is my representative, she believes on a “light touch” regulatory regime [that] will promote additional investment in broadband. Also that "Chairman Pai has been transparent about his plans"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS:

Dear Mr. esMazer,
Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns regarding the governance of the internet.  This topic is sometimes referred to as net neutrality or an open internet.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.

First, let me assure you that I am committed to ensuring that the Internet is a level playing field, where competition ensures that consumers benefit from continued innovation and where all companies are held to the same high standards of consumer protection.

As a point of reference, until 2015, the Internet was regulated with a “light touch” framework under Title I of the Communications Act.  In fact, during the Clinton Administration, there was a bipartisan, intentional decision to reject heavy-handed regulation as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  As a complement to such regulation, the Federal Trade Commission was the “cop on the beat” to address any anti-competitive and anti-consumer behavior.

By all accounts, this “light touch” has been highly successful, with the private sector investing over $1.5 trillion to build out wired and wireless networks throughout the United States.  This unprecedented explosion of innovation and investment in technology in the United States includes the establishment and growth of many companies with some of the largest valuations of private corporations in history.

In 2015, the then-Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decided to apply a regulatory structure designed for a 1930s, monopoly wired telephone network, by reclassifying broadband providers under Title II of the Communications Act.  This is a heavy-handed regulatory framework that was crafted in the Roosevelt Administration.  Economic experts have found that the imposition of this regulatory regime has chilled investment in Internet infrastructure.  In fact, broadband network investment declined by $3.6 billion since 2015.  Most worrisome, our rural and low-income areas, that most need access to the Internet to thrive, have been hard hit by this reduction in investment.

The current FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, recently announced that he would seek to return to the pre-Title II regulation of the Internet.  Chairman Pai has been transparent about his plans and released his proposed order on November 21st, 2017, long before the agency’s December 14th Open Meeting.  The proposed order would also require Internet Service Providers to tell consumers what their net neutrality policies are.  This requirement will allow for more informed consumers.

Despite the media furor, Title II and net neutrality are not one and the same.  The proposal before the FCC simply returns the internet to the 2015 status—when there were few reports of data throttling or other anti-consumer behaviors.  The Internet has always thrived on innovation, not government control.  Under Chairman Pai’s plan, the FCC will retain an oversight role and require transparency to all consumers related to prioritization traffic, data caps, and other concerns.  The FTC can challenge anti-competitive behavior on a case by case basis, which is better suited to a fast changing, nimble, and cutting-edge industry.

I believe the “light touch” regulatory regime will promote additional investment in broadband.  The private sector has proved far better than the government at developing choices and lowering prices for consumers.  I want to spur investment and access to broadband services in rural and low-income areas to allow more constituents and small businesses access to the internet.

Thank you again for contacting me.  It is a privilege to serve you in the Tenth District.  I may also be contacted at my Sterling office at 703-404-6903, or my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-5136.

360 Title: Sen. John Boozman (R-AR). He sold me and others in my state, and this nation to the telecom lobby for the price of $56,450Got the price from: https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale

I spent at least 20 minutes on a letter I wrote to him through the senate website where you can contact. I only got a template response. 

Thank you for contacting me to express your thoughts on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) plan to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs). It is good to hear from you.

As you may know, a D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled on January 14, 2014, that the FCC lacked the authority to impose network neutrality restrictions on broadband providers. In response, on May 15, 2014, the FCC announced a ‘Notice of Proposed Rulemaking’ (NPRM) to reclassify ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act effectively expanding the FCC’s authority to impose restrictions on ISPs.

Although the FCC Chairman and Commissioners are nominated by the President, the FCC is an independent agency under the jurisdiction of Congress. On November 10, 2014, President Obama publicly urged the FCC to ensure that new rules would include the reclassification of ISPs and impose more strict regulations on broadband providers. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have launched investigations to determine whether the White House improperly influenced the FCC’s independent rulemaking process. I believe that congressional oversight is an entrusted responsibility of Congress that ensures government accountability and transparency, a duty that I take very seriously.

On February 26, 2015, in a 3-2 final decision, the FCC ruled to reclassify ISPs as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. I have serious concerns that this ruling and outdated regulatory overreach, will stifle technological advances, open the door to costly litigation and ultimately lead to job losses. I believe in protecting an open, free and vibrant Internet. Congress has a duty to see that our laws are fair, not only to the companies involved, but also to citizens across the nation that use technology every day. I believe the FCC should focus on removing barriers to competition and allowing the private sector to more effectively allocate our broadband resources. Please know that I will keep your thoughts in mind as we continue to debate telecommunications issues in the 115th Congress.

Again, thank you for contacting me to share your views. Please visit www.boozman.senate.gov to sign up for my e-newsletter, request assistance with a federal agency, or learn more about my efforts on behalf of the people of Arkansas. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.
rot in hell
Seriously? You shouldn't say that as it makes us seem like our voice isn't worth taking as it's childish. You should point out their flaws, and debate them or put it in the spotlight so people can see. No insults, nothing illegal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
361 Title: I'm actually really scared..You could just ask for a phone number if communicating via internet would become a difficulty.
Are you suggesting a reasonable solution to this poor girl’s problems?! How dare you!
Vote when you can so the people making you scared won't be able to affect you any more. 
i have very similar fears about friends and my connections to them. don't worry about it they can't break those connections it makes no sense too, this will impair our freedom on the internet but certainly this does not End the internet.

Skype probably won't be affected as hard. They're owned by Microsoft who can probably afford to take the preferential fee hit. If you used, like, kik, maybe it would be more serious. 
Voice would probably not be affected as much since it’s bitrate is stupidly low (<32kb/s) versus video (~1920kb/s for 15mbps). Also, as others have said, get a phone number.
To be 100% honest with you I'm just as terrified as you right now but you can't let that fear get to you, if your afraid of this then fight with us to stop it, it's the only way Bro.
> the idea of never being able to contact her again because of net neutrality disappearing terrifies me
>
>we had access to a free internet. 
>
>Is that we might not ever talk to each other again. 

1) How would repealing net neutrality stop you from ever contacting a person again? That's beyond hyperbole.

2) You didn't. You had access to paid internet. It's not free.

3) Do you not own a phone?
That why you need to tell me people about this issue
I feel your pain brother im scared too. me and everyone I know our trying our best to make sure net neutrality stays not only for us but for the generations to come I would suggest maybe getting her phone number so you can contact her if ajit pai wins :/
You do not need to be afraid of that. Why would your (wired, I assume) ISP have interest in not allowing you to talk to your friend? 
I suppose it's because we use services that might be targeted. Namely Skype and Google Hangouts. 


If we're resorting back to how internet was in 2015... what the fuck are you guys all worried about. No one complained back then, it's a non issue
It's reddit. This site is full of idiots that are easily swayed into believing anything with hardly any intelligent discussion or analysis. I'm convinced this site has devolved into a highly effective pay-for-play ad site. Basically a propaganda machine.

374 Title: Pissed off, Scared European here. How to help?I'd pay a lot for net neutrality
Same.

I guess the only thing I know is to call the FCC.
I tried calling but it doesn't get me through :/ 
Thank you, well you should tell pretty much anyone who will listen and try to make them understand what's going and why this is bad, we need more people to know about this, we need more people to fight with us.
Honestly I think this is best for the future of the web. Letting the FCC regulate the internet without directive from congress is just going to be a mess. As evidence by the current situation. We need congress to act otherwise every administration is going to be able to flip flop on this. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

376 Title: Response from NC Senator Thom TillisIncrease competetion? No! The monopolized ISPs win not due to competetive pricing but due to being the only ones to cover many areas.
Exactly. If everyone had a dozen ISPs to choose from, there wouldn’t be an issue.

381 Title: What are we supposed to do with all these senator posts? Is it a hit list???Don't vote for them. Associate their faces with greed and a lack of sympathy. Associate their faces with the reason your internet sucks in a year. Don't reelect them. 
actively campaign for anyone but them. buy me once shame you, buy me twice, shame on...thor 
In a political sense yes. They as representatives of the people are supposed to act in our best interests but when they support and condone the destruction of a policy which benefits everyone and that all their supporters are for without demonstrating one shred of credible evidence for the things they claim prompted this wildly unpopular repeal then it is our duty as citizens united to actively vote against the corrupt and self serving who are hindering our democratic process and misrepresenting the strongly held values of their constituents. They do not support their people so the people most vote for those who do and against them.
This is not a hit list, It's to know who to support and trust and who to not, that's what this is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
382 Title: If only you people could spend as much energy stopping governments from preventing innovation with ISPs.Actually, the main reason is that we're allowing huge goddamn monopolies like Comcast in the first place. 
T-mobile is a decent example of why this will never happen. T-mobile started off smaller, with a crappy network, but everyone switched to them because they offered pro-consumer policy, which is what we all want on here. Now, they are no better than Verizon or AT&T.

383 Title: Sold outone issue at a time. we are the internet generation. this is _our_ tool. it comes first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
384 Title: Support for Net Neutrality has actually gone down since June, when they did the last public poll on Net Neutrality. It went from 60% pro Net Neutrality to 52%. These are not the overwhelming numbers we need to force Ajit Pai to back down or to cause congress to intercede.At the risk of sounding like a major conspiracy theorist, I for one do not believe any of the major news sources when it comes to coverage on this subject. It has been clear since before Trump took office that the vast majority of Americans support net neutrality, and understand that repealing the current set of laws would benefit only the telecommunications industry, and by extension the congressmen and women they lobby. It is not an unreasonable idea that, in addition to paying legislators to vote in their favor, they would also pay the larger news outlets to run false information that would support their aims. In the end it's a question of trust. Do you trust your government to act in the best interests of their constituents, and do you trust the news corporations (the emphasis on "corporations") to remain impartial when they've demonstrated an almost pathological inability to do so for the past 20 some-odd years? 

Failing that just listen to the people around you. I live and work with some pretty die-hard conservatives, and every one of them I talk to think we are getting absolutely shafted by the FCC and the big telecoms. 
You dont sound like a conspiracy theorist at all. Three top sources for cable news televisin have dedicated a combined total of 2 minutes to coverage on this topic on the tube. 
Dos minutos. 

edit: [this](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/11/28/study-shows-corporate-cable-networks-largely-ignoring-fcc-plan-kill-net-neutrality) article is my citation, and if you add in the msnbc network that actually did [a 14 min piece on net neutrality](http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/net-neutrality-undoing-by-fcc-raises-fears-for-open-internet-1103838787706), youve got 16 minutes total coverage. 
I feel like I’m inside a car, during an extreme slow motion accident. I can see that it’s coming but there are moments of hope during our death spin. Like, when the driver remembered to turn into the skid. Or that other time, when he tried pumping his brakes rather than just slamming them down. However, that giant ISP truck is hurtling its way ever closer to us. Physics and extremely wealthy ISPs can’t be reasoned with. It’s what they do. Physics adheres to Newtonian rules and ISPs behave their shareholders when they demand maximum profit.

But you needn’t fret lowly ISP customer. Heck, [Comcast already said it wouldn’t accept money for priority access](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-deleted-net-neutrality-pledge-the-same-day-fcc-announced-repeal/) . And they kept that promise for nearly 3 years. That’s a hell of a long time. They should feel proud of that. “They are so proud in fact, they feel they have earned your trust *ISP costumer 87762892* and yours too, *ISP customer 62628928* **(by the way, you’re late on this months bill. So, remember to tack on an extra $50 for the late fee)**. 

Now to the good news, they are going to use that trust and make your lives easier by removing one more thing to worry about: [Net Neutrality, just don’t worry your pretty little consumer heads about it anymore. We’ll take care of it for you](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/comcast-to-customers-just-trustus-about-changed-net-neutrality-pledges/). We may only be worth 193.5 billion dollars but we still have our strength. And we will use that strength to protect and shelter you from the worry and hassle of Net Neutrality.

Now you look like your getting sleepy..... no more worrying about inconsequential things. Everything is going to be oooookkkkkkk. Now, sssshhhhhhh. Now turn offf your brain and take out your wallet.

Edit: I got carried away with my silliness. 


["NBC, ABC, and CBS have devoted just over two minutes combined to net neutrality since FCC chair Pai unveiled his plan to scrap the rules"](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/11/28/study-shows-corporate-cable-networks-largely-ignoring-fcc-plan-kill-net-neutrality)

2 minutes...


Your right, we need something more, we need something bigger, we need to start a revolution, to put a stop to this once and for all, let's take back our freedom from this power hungry scumbags and show them we have the power, who's with me?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
385 Title: Is anyone willing to boycott to save Net Neutrality?To save Net Neutrality? anything, we aren't their bitch, we need to stand up.
I am. If internet got too be too much of a hassle/too expensive, I’d just cancel it. I know I’m well in the minority, but most of day to day functions of life wouldn’t be affected for me. My hobbies would change; I’d read more books and less Reddit. I’d just go to the library whenever I really needed to do something on the Internet. But I recognize that not everyone can do that. 
Of course, not everyone can give up the internet.  Nor should they have to.

But there are smaller steps people can take.  Not all companies that benefit from the end of Net Neutrality are ISPs -- some are content providers that benefit because they'll be able to partner with ISPs who will make it harder for new entrants to reach an audience.  Netflix is my example, but I'm sure there are others.


Ask the millions of people who are currently willing customers of companies like t-mobile which regularly violates net neutrality. 

At the end of the day, people will fall in line and it won’t be that big of a deal. I’m sure people who benefitted from slave ownership said the same thing when the slaves were freed, but we made it out of that just fine. 
Slave were freed because people fought a war.  Small potatoes compared to giving up Netflix, I think.
We cannot just take this so willingly. Why is everyone just gonna except being screwed over by these net neutrality haters. We have to fight for what is fair and right. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
386 Title: If net neutrality does get repealedI've tried telling a few friends and family members about this issue and they either don't seem to be interested or if they're conservative they'll tell me "Oh, we should have less government control anyways." These same people sit on facebook all damn day, like how can you not care? The internet is going to die!

It's funny, because I actually was telling a coworker about it as he was on his phone watching YouTube, totally uninterested. The fucking pinnacle of irony right there if I've ever seen it.
Exactly!! I mean it is so damn frustrating! I’ve tried telling sooo many people but they just look at me like I’m a crazy person.I live with my bf, so he has to hear about most of it. He’ll just nod and tell me he “understands” and “agrees” but then doesn’t do a damn thing. I told him I wanted to put a flyer on the billboard for the apt about this and he basically told me to give up on fighting this because I don’t have a say in the matter, only the FCC does.  So I told him when the internet goes to crap and gets turned into cable, I’m laughing in the face of every single person who ignored me.  I’m with OP on this, when it turns into overpriced crap, they’ll all see!!! They’ll wish they  had listened. Until then, I’m going to keep fighting. AND I’m making that goddamn flyer!!!
to be honest, we are trying so hard to stop the FCC from removing net neutrality and well when its gone and people see what AT&T, Comcast and everyone else do, there gonna try and fight to get it back. Well at the point it might be too late. That's what im worried about, it getting repealed and everyone wondering why everything is behind paywall and want everything to go back. We would just be sitting there and telling them, you should have listen to me and try to fight this before it got removed

387 Title: This is my representatives response to me announcing my support to net neutrality.Way better than mine 





Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality. 

Since the Clinton administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had regulated the broadband industry with a light touch, allowing the Internet to flourish. Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s decision to reclassify broadband service under Title II — its misnamed “Open Internet Order” — broke with bipartisan tradition. This reclassification imposed heavy-handed utility-style regulations on internet services and led to greater government control of the Internet.  

This heavy-handed regulation has caused investment in Internet infrastructure to decline.  According to the FCC, among the nation’s 12 largest internet service providers, domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6 percent, or $3.6 billion, between 2014 and 2016. As the new chairman of the FCC recently explained, “regulations designed for monopoly will push the market further toward monopoly.” This is not what is best for citizens of Wisconsin or the rest of the country.  

One of my top priorities is to ensure the expansion of high-speed broadband throughout Wisconsin. On May 18, 2017, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for broadband services that was a welcome development. This action restores the light-touch regulation that allowed for a free and open Internet for nearly 20 years.

Thank you again for contacting my office. It is very helpful to hear the views of the constituents I serve. Please see my website at www.ronjohnson.senate.gov for additional information. It is an honor representing you and all the people of Wisconsin.
Sincerely,

Ron Johnson
United States Senator

395 Title: A dumb but serious questionI honestly fear it will everyday I go on the internet. Because not enough people are talking about this. 
My SO (who I vent to about this issue all the time) basically told me to just give up today. 
When I try to tell friends and family members they pretty much look at me like I’m some crazy lady. I have posted about net neutrality several times and linked to websites on my platform but no one seems interested. 
I just wish I were someone more “famous”. 
I feel like more people would listen then.
Either way, I’m still going to fight for it and you should too! I’m even going to my first ever protest on 12/7!
Remember even if it does pass, Congress may still be able to stop them.

I don't think that's the case at all. The point of trolling is to get a reaction, your vote is anonymous, and (as far as I know) there is no way to prove to anyone else who you voted for. 

If you really wanted to troll, you would SAY you voted for Trump, not actually do it.

That's actually a really well-worded response. If you read it a certain way, it almost sounds like he wants to overhaul telecommunications legislation without necessarily giving private companies free reigns.

422 Title: A composer on net neutrality--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
423 Title: Battle for the NetI am not a gamer, but I have wondered this: If whatever platform you used paid a little extra to your ISP to ensure you always had a great connection (low/no latency, always 10-15 Mbps faster than whatever other traffic might be coming your way), would you be against that? That seems like a pretty good deal for you, no?
That is not the problem it is two fold.
1. With monopoly power(which a lot of ISPs have)  there is no incentive to speed up someone’s connection. There is an incentive to throttle a connection so you pay more for the service you need. Why would a company  speed up your connection if it can slow it down instead.
2. The more of the population that needs the fast connection ie:)streaming gaming the more the service will look like it did before.  If everyone needs a fast connection it will amount to just the same service with a fee being paid to ISP. 
I would be against that

Also, this is definitely a biased map, because population density. Its not fair to say that over half the US has just one provider, because a lot more people live in the North East than in the Mid West. 
Someone on twitter made it based on the information from government data here: https://www.broadbandmap.gov/number-of-providers

428 Title: Got a response to my Net Neutrality letter from House Representitive Glenn Grothman. Can I get some help with a response? I'm not educated enough on the issue to really ask him more, or respond to the deflections.I think the main points are:

1 
The FCC did not consult Congress, and he seems to be hurt about it. The truth is, the FCC already has the power to make such changes without consulting Congress, in fact the process for the FCC to approve changes is to propose them, publish them publicly and wait. The FCC is obligated to hear opinions. Once they do, the board then moves to a vote.

2
He is also mentioning the classic regulations hurt the economy argument... I think some regulation is always necessary. In this case without a net neutrality regulation the ISPs will simply throttle the speed and/or bandwidth of the connection for those customers who do not pay a lot of money.

447 Title: Can I still watch porn?I don't know about the porn thing, but the repeal of nn is an American issue so it can't affect Europe.
It very much can affect Europe, if the service is based in the US.

There will be no governing body to stop an ISP from throttling porn sites that aren't willing to pay up to keep hosting the literally trillions of HD porn vids.

---

Take something more mainstream for example. Netflix is a competing service to an ISP; it'll get throttled in the US - Netflix can pay the ISP to stay competitive in speeds - in turn they have to charge customers more to stay profitable - all Netflix subscriptions prices rise worldwide to compensate.

---

Not that I expect the ISP's to be hosting a competing porn site, just that they eat tons of bandwidth, host millions of videos, and absolutely don't have the same level of revenue as something like Netflix or YouTube, they're going to be easy targets for ISP's to throttle, and ransom; and that will affect all users worldwide if that service is based in the US.

---

Don't worry though OP, Porn isn't going to be illegal or anything (Except the stuff that is already illegal). But ISP's may likely turn their attention to porn sites in the near future because of their typical hosting, bandwidth usage, and that they think not many people are going to publicly defend porn sites.

However I can guarantee you they track that data, both now, and more closely in the future. So I hope you're comfortable with your kinks if you have to make that stand for porn.
Wait but Europe has it's own laws and the ISP has to abide by those laws. So even if nn is repealed by the FCC in the US, the ISP still has to follow what the European version of the FCC  decides in Europe. Tho porn will be safe there's no doubt about that.
After the repeal? not a chance, if you don't want that to happen help to fight with us, we gotta take this back, it's the only way Dude.

"Address the growing demand for bandwidth and increasing usage..." 

You mean how ISP's got paid govt subsidies (ie: tax dollars) to lay down fiber obtics wires but never did such a thing, and instead intentionally throttle speeds pretending that its because too many people use the internet?

I dont know what is more infuriating. The fact that these people are trying to control and monetize every aspect of the internet, thereby destroying it, or the blatant lies they tell us all. As if we are so stupid we will just nod and say okay. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
449 Title: I built a Twitter bot that reminds the FCC about Net Neutrality once every 5 minutes.This is counterproductive. You're giving the FCC a way to say that net neutrality support comes from bots.
Bots aren't hard to make, I could make them and make adjustments to make it seem less boty but at the end of the day it's a bad ideal, not to mention unethical.
Yer in fact correct. the worst kind of correct. But I dont believe for an instant the politics that are being played right now by ajit and these representatives wouldn't be played no matter what tactic the people used to shout their disapproval. It doesnt matter ye do cause there is always more politicking to be had to get yer way. especially when ye have spent a lot of booty on this already. AHOY! 
This is just giving the FCC better leverage to say that Net Neutrality support comes from bots, not people. OP a bot reminding them won’t make them change their mind, it will only annoy them and make people who see the replicate tweets think that Net Neutrality is only supported by bots, please delete or turn off the bot.
You are amazing

468 Title: Why is ending Net Neutrality bad?How can you find a new company if your ISP blocks them? If Comcast, for example, doesn't like a company for some reason because it might harm them, they will block them so they can get ahead. It is a short way to put it. 
What your describing would be the optimal setting however, large telecom companies have been cutting up the country now for decades and price fixing behind closed doors so your options are limited. Google Fiber is having a hard time getting set up in some areas because of this. Competition would be greatly welcome to the market however two thing that TITLE 2 brings to the table for consumer protection is that ISP's can not perform preferential treatment of customers with regards to access and treatment, and two is price protections. They can not change the price on you overnight and must inform you when they change price or conditions of service.

If anything repealing current net neutrality laws will remove more competition for local areas and prevent innovation as telecom companies are interested in getting the most money out of as little spent as possible which means bear minimum infrastructure upgrades and high service costs. if someone comes along to challenge they can outspend them and out-price them till they die out then go back to the way it was in an area. There would also be nothing stopping telecom companies from completely ignoring small rural areas that would not net them much profit.

479 Title: My Senator professionally told me to go fuck myself.I was just about to post an identical email I got from Tillis today.  Cute, isn’t it?
Same here. I'm from Oklahoma and Jim Inhofe replied to me with something practically identical. I hate that guy, The worst part is that I spent over thirty minutes typing out a stern reply, but that imbecile's inbox is "full." So nice to live in a plutocracy. But let's just keep pretending it's a democracy. You know, for fun.
I say make note of this come elections, and spread the word. The sooner people like him are out of power the better.
Very excited for the mid-terms. 
Probably barely knows how to check his own email. 
Took him eight business days to respond. 
Well where to start, I'll start with much gratitude towards (Lord) Senator Tillis for allowing, no, no granting a U.S. Citizen and constituent of his (subject/peasant) contact him regarding anything else in the future of 'importance' excluding 'Net Neutrality'. 

Secondly, we all know this letter was written by the lobbyist, 'think-tank' secretly sponsored by the Koch Brothers.

Thirdly, it is of course filled with factual and misguided errors. 

-[FCC didn't vote in secret in 02/2015 in fact it was at their open public meeting. Yes, they probably debated and researched and discussed in private, but they didn't vote in private](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2015/02/february-2015-open-commission-meeting). here is another source of open public meeting/vote:[here](https://www.cnet.com/news/net-neutrality-a-reality-fcc-votes-to-bring-internet-under-utility-style-rules/).
  


-Yes, for 50 years (1934-1984) the telecom companies thrived. Including infrastructure investing and a return on their investment, but also, Under the hampering [Government Regulations AT&T became a monopoly which had to be broken up into smaller regional companies](http://www.aei.org/publication/lessons-att-break-30-years-later/). Here is another source: [here](http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/att-merger-history/index.html).

and I have to go to work now, I'm a little upset about this Senator's Response...
Thanks, I used some of these sources in the reply I just sent Tillis.  It looks like he's sending our form letters, and probably not reading our letters to him, but worth a try.
I got a very similar email today from Texas Senator John Cornyn. So disappointed in our legislators.
the forth and fifth paragraphs are amazing.. in the fourth it just sounds like the whole over regulations is stifling growth an preventing improved services to. Without the regulation company's can reduce services to people based on what they decide they need. 

This is written in such a way where anyone who is unclear of what it's saying would thing it makes perfect sense. Big bad government hurting companies that just are looking out for our own well being. 
Yep, I got the exact same email from Tillis today, its bullshit how they don't give a shit about what their constituents think.
Please do not hesitate to get in touch with him again about other issues he got bribed about
Does he even know how to internet?

Keep fighting the good fight! ✊
This pisses me off the people supposedly elected to represent **our** interests lie to our face and are only representing big business that pays them to.
North Carolina representative Mr. Tom Tillis recieved "$41,220.00" from his friends in the tele-communications industry this past election year. Tillis know that to earn that extra 40k from his constituents, copy and pasting this email when his "constituents" express their concerns is necessary. It can be a tough part of the job, but it must be done; and with expert clicking finesse.

It's important to remember that everyone, including Senators, are entitled to their own opinions, even on topics such as this.

It's also important to remind them that you won't be able to support someone who doesn't represent you in the next election. That's the only way to get a Senator/Congressman's attention without having billions of dollars to "donate."
My issue is that it's not actually his opinion.
It's tens of thousands of dollars from Telecom companies that decide this stuff. 
Got a similar letter from Palazzo.
how has it hampered innovation and also WHY DID YOU SELL OUT YOUR CONSTITUENTS FOR A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS!?!? come election you guys should vote them out.

480 Title: My congressman supports net neutrality 😉Here's the full reply:

Thank you for contacting me with your views regarding net neutrality. I appreciate the time you took to share your views and your patience while waiting for a response.

On February 26, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled to move the Internet from Title I to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This “Open Internet” or “Net Neutrality” order, as it is been colloquially named, allows the FCC to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers. The reclassification was intended to allow the FCC to enforce net neutrality regulations that are intended to prohibit paid prioritization, throttling, and blocking of lawful content.

With the advancement of modern technology, and the important role the Internet plays in our economy, it is essential that the federal government ensures that the Internet remains free and open to all lawful content. That is why the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have put in place enforcement mechanisms that protect existing laws and protocols that govern Internet practices. The 2015 rule created additional regulatory requirements that cedes enforcement authority of the Internet to the FCC that previously were non-existent.

What’s more troubling, the Obama Administration has failed to demonstrate why the enforcement of existing anti-trust statutes would not offer adequate protections for consumers. Any major changes to the regulation of the Internet and ISPs should be done through legislation, not laws that were passed in 1934.

That is why I believe that regulating the Internet with a law that was enacted in 1934 is a misguided approach. Returning to the light-touch regulations that have been in place since the Clinton Administration is the right approach. Under the leadership of Chairman Pai, the FCC recently voted in favor of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled “Restoring Internet Freedom” to start the process of rolling back key provisions of the Open Internet order.

Rather than focusing government resources on burdensome regulation, we should be redirecting our focus on improving affordable internet access, especially in high-cost rural areas. Both the FCC and Congress, have been looking at ways to reduce barriers that hinder companies from not only laying the foundation for new internet groundwork, but improving upon existing internet infrastructure as well. For example, in April 2017, the FCC established a Rural Broadband Auctions Task Force that will help ensure funds are directed towards projects in communities who need it the most. In Congress, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia also recently introduced H.R. 2870 – The Gigabit Opportunity (GO) Act, to help spur broadband investment in many rural and low-income communities.

I believe it is time for both Congress and the FCC to develop meaningful reforms that encourages investment and innovation in the Internet marketplace, while protecting the individual rights of consumers in the process.

It is important that the citizens of California’s First Congressional District keep me informed of their views so that I may better represent you in Washington. Please be assured that I will keep your comments in mind should legislation related to net neutrality come before the House of Representatives for a vote.

If you would like to stay connected to our office with the latest news, legislation, and other useful information, please visit my website at http://lamalfa.house.gov. Thank you again for writing to me. It is an honor to be your representative in Congress.

Sincerely,

California? Obviously. Taking away net neutrality would put the YouTubers in a rage.

Plus Cali is pretty liberal anyway. I'm generally not surprised.

484 Title: Should I be worried?Basically the long and short of it is we need to get the gov. (our elected officials especially) to publicly address the issue, get the word to the people, get the people to help them in mobilizing congress, and if we can't get congress to block the repeal by telling them we'll vote them out for not supporting us then it falls to the courts to sort out. After that it falls to both states (passing their own NN protections and fighting the federal government/FCC on states being able to have their own protections) and a the public to elect new officials who will support them and will remove FCC heads who pushed this through and another uphill battle to reinstating all our NN protections. That's the best tldr of our options at this point and if you want to know about the legal aspect take a look here @ 12:30:

essentially they (the courts) can strike down the repeal if they (FCC) have no credible reason for pushing it, which:

what do you mean? Congress has control over Net Neutrality, not the FCC. That is why many companies have been bribing congressmen. A repeal has to go through both houses. I'm not sure about what percentage of the house has been bribed, but since it won't be able to be repealed in the Senate, it can't be repealed. If you think differently, could you please explain to me how?

489 Title: Appeal to The Lawmakers (Plus a Letter to The Netizens (in Comments))Dear American Netizens,

Please know that everything we have; our bodies, families, friends, material possessions and even our politicians and regulations have been given to us by God. Some things were given to us directly by Him while other things were guided to us through others but also by Him.

He is the One that gives. He is also the One that takes.

Know that He exists and that He is One so that us too may be as one. 

Put your faith in Him alone with no partners and don't forget to be thankful to Him for your blessings and have no doubt that He will bless you even further.

Remember God and He will remember you. Forget Him and He will take away what He gave.

Remember him regardless of the situation and learn to give thanks even in the most dire of predicaments. 

I don't know about the whole god thing (seeing as all our legal documentation and framework was written by regular old people) but right on my religious buddy. It's morally and ethically reprehensible to destroy one of the last true remaining bastions of free speech afforded to us in this country and we'd be remised if we took this injustice lying down.

Hey, we think the same!!! 👍
Net neutrality should be saved anyway because is a security (but doesn't mean that all those catastrophic things that people are saying will happen) but people actually been unfair. They used that Portuguese plain that paying a little more you don't waste your traffic (other users access to the app anyway **without block or throttling** , is **exactly the same** as Vodafone Passport that I had) and use it for make the "Net neutrality phobia" stronger. Pretty unfair.

499 Title: I am in favor of repealing title 2I'm really questioning your "extensive research" because almost every claim you make in this statement is completely backwards and straight up incorrect. 
Hrm according to what i've read this is all accurate. Feel free to help set me straight if i've gotten anything wrong? (I plan to sit down and talk with my Republican senator next week about introducing a bill for net neutrality so any comments on facts I may have incorrect would be more helpful than downvotes)
I am with you on this. Cable TV is getting better and better as companies move to IPTV and with Netflix and YouTube clogging up the pipes, it should be very well the ISP's right to charge them more so that they can continue working on innovating their services.

I always wondered why my Mediacom cable TV sucked so bad, and thought it was just the way cable was going to be forever, but now with Cox I have a hybrid IPTV setup that includes Netflix on the box (yup), and it's freaking awesome. Sure it costs more, but with price comes features, and you have to pay to play.

I can't wait until this gets repealed so we can move on into the future.
Hrm, I guess you didn't read what I wrote. You must be one of those people that doesn't read the article that that frontpage post was talking about.
